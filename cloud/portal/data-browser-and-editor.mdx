| 5        | Recall previously executed queries, import one or more documents as JSON or CSV files; export all the data in the current collection, only result data, or specific data based on your selection; and switch between table** **and tree** **view.    |

| 7        | Write queries in DQL, check syntax and semantics, autoformat, view query results, get immediate error feedback, and more.                                                                                                                            |
| 8        | Expand and view query results in JSON, move between different results, and copy the results that display.                                                                                                                                            |



<Warning>
  Use single quotes in DQL queries to ensure accuracy. Incorrectly using double quotes (""); for example "blue", may prevent document matching. Currently, Ditto does not throw a warning for this issue.
