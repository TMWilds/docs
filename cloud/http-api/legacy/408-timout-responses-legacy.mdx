<Info>
To manage performance and prevent potential performance issues that may occur as a result to attempting to retrieve a large number of documents in a single query, by default, sets of matching documents is limited to a count of 1000.
</Info>


To resolve this error, break down one large query into several selective queries.

For example, the following cURL request:

- Retrieves documents within the `people` collection with the field property of `name` set to the value of `John`.
- Limits the number of results returned to `2`.
- Instructs to `sort` results by `_id` in ascending (`asc`) order.
- Indicates that the response is to include not only the values but also information (`latestValuesAndTypes`) about their types.

```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://{app_id}.cloud.ditto.live/api/v4/store/find' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY' \
  --data-raw '{
    "collection": "people",
    "query": "name==\'John\'",
    "limit": 2,
    "sort": [
      {"property": "_id", "direction": "asc"}
    ],
    "serializedAs": "latestValuesAndTypes"
}'
```


Once invoked, you'd receive the following response:

```json JSON
{
  "value": {
    "_id": "123abc",
    "fields": {
      "name": {
          "register": { "value": "John" },
      },
      "friends": {
          "register": { "value": ["Susan"] },
      },
      "orderCount": {
          "counter": { "value": 5 }
      },
    }
  }
}
```
