Removed: the DittoRGA constructor. You cannot create new RGAs.



Removed: the deprecated DittoMutableRGA type. You cannot mutate existing RGAs.



Deprecated: DittoDocument.typed`<Codable>`(as:) method.



Deprecated: DittoMutableDocument.typed`<Codable>`(as:) method.



Deprecated: DittoTypedDocument``<Decodable>`` class.

Deprecated: DittoPendingIDSpecificOperation.update`<Codable>`(using:) method.



Deprecated: DittoScopedWriteTransaction.upsert`<Codable>`(\_,writeStrategy:) method.



Deprecated: DittoWriteTransactionPendingIDSpecificOperation.update`<Codable>`(using:) method.



Removed: observe() and observeWithNextSignal() methods of DittoPendingCollectionsOperation, DittoPendingCursorOperation, and DittoPendingIDSpecificOperation. Please use the corresponding observeLocal(deliverOn:eventHandler:) and observeLocalWithNextSignal(deliverOn:eventHandler:) variants along with a separate call to subscribe() instead. See https://docs.ditto.live/ios/common/concepts/syncing-data#subscribe



Added: class DittoPresence as entry point for all of presence functionality, accessible via the newly introduced presence property on the Ditto object.



Added: struct DittoPresenceGraph and related sub-types DittoAddress, DittoConnection, DittoConnectionType, and DittoPeer.



 DittoPresence.GraphPublisher, replaces the now deprecated Ditto.RemotePeersPublisher. You can get a graph publisher via the graphPublisher() on the newly introduced DittoPresence (accessible via newly introduced presence property of Ditto).



Deprecated: methods observePeers() and observePeersV2() of Ditto, please use observe() of DittoPresence instead (accessible via newly introduced presence property of Ditto).



Deprecated: DITRemotePeer, replaced by DITPeer.

Removed: all persistenceDirectory arguments from all of the identity type constructors.



Changed: performance improvements.



Added: disableSyncWithV2 method to Ditto. This allows you to explicitly opt-in to disabling the ability to sync with Ditto peers running any version of the SDK in the v2 series of releases. Assuming this succeeds then this peer will only be able to sync with other peers using SDKs in the v3 series of releases. Note that this disabling of sync spreads to peers that sync with a peer that has disabled, or has (transitively) had disabled, syncing with v2 SDK peers.



Improved: reliability if app crashes occur while persisting authentication data.



Added: statusPublisher() method to DittoAuthenticator.



Added: DittoAuthenticator.StatusPublisher, a Combine publisher for DittoAuthenticationStatus change events.



Improved: log increased detail to help debug blocked write transactions.
