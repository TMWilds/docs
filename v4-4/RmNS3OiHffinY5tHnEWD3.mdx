### C++ Linux / iOS Version 1.0.5

Released: Fri Jun 25th 2021, 3:36 pm

Release Notes:

- Added a new **find** function that accepts a query containing placeholders in the form of **$args.my\_arg** along with a map of query arguments in the form of **\{ "my\_arg": "some value" }**. The placeholders in the query will be replaced by a query-appropriate representation of the relevant value from the map of query arguments.
- Added the ability to get a hash and/or a mnemonic (string) representation of the matching documents from a live query event. This means you can do something like this:
- Fix for using floats in queries.
- Accessing the **store** property of a **Ditto** instance will no longer throw an error if you have not yet activated your **Ditto** instance with a valid license token.
- Deprecated **set\_access\_license** and added a new function, **set\_license\_token**, which will throw an appropriate exception if your provided license token is expired or invalid somehow.
- Deprecated **start\_sync** and added a new function, **try\_start\_sync**, which will throw an exception if your **Ditto** instance hasn't yet been activated via a successful call to **set\_license\_token**.

### C++ Linux / iOS Version 1.0.0

Released: Wed Apr 21st 2021, 5:29 pm

Release Notes:

- This release is not compatible with any previous SDK releases. There are a number of breaking changes both in terms of the SDK API and in terms of the internal systems used by the SDK to perform operations such as synchronization. If you have previously made use of the Ditto SDK and wish to update to this version then note that you will need to delete all existing Ditto data otherwise you will run into errors. If you have existing data that you need to keep then please contact us and we can advise you as to how you can migrate your data.
- The most notable API breaking changes are:
  - Document IDs are no longer restricted to just strings. You can now create a document ID that is a string, integer, boolean, array, map, or null. This means that when making
  - The
- Lots of performance improvements and bug fixes.
