title : "Ditto v4 for JavaScript"
---




JavaScript Version 4.4.5[](#VabhG)
==================================

Released: Fri Nov 17, 2023



SDK version/language/platform and device name are now included in the small peer info document. (#10515)

JavaScript Version 4.4.4[](#fTmKV)
==================================

Released: Thur Nov 2, 2023



Runtime validation of corrupted attachments being inserted into documents (#10552)



An issue introduced in 4.4.2 where the Small Peer Info attachments were not replicated to the Portal. (#10538)



The smallPeerInfo property to Ditto allowing to configure the collection and sync of Small Peer Info. (#10525)

JavaScript Version 4.4.2[](#6KCo6)
==================================



Small Peer info collection now defaults to localPeerOnly, preventing data from being collected on the Big Peer until the feature is explicitly enabled and sync scope is set to bigPeerOnly. (#10203, #10204)

JavaScript Version 4.4.1[](#5ByOi)
==================================



Persistence directories on Windows are now automatically normalized to prevent Windows' restrictions on path lenghts from causing disk access failure. (#9980)



Configuring Ditto with a persistence directory that is not readable or writable now shows an error message and aborts initialization. (#9833)

JavaScript Version 4.4.0[](#1JwAp)
==================================

⚠️ **Deprecated** \- hash() and hashMnemonic()  methods on live query events were deprecated. Use the methods with the same name on the Document class instead. (#9661, #9610)



More informative log message for query failures caused by database access errors. (#9364)



Small peers now persist structured log data to disk for later retrieval, with limits on the resulting disk usage. (#9547)



More informative log message for query failures caused by database access errors. (#9364)



Print some internal errors in a more human-readable format. (#9269)



TransportConfig and its associated types can be serialized/deserialized into/from JSON and CBOR. (#9585)



Sets a minimum session refresh period. The small peer will always try to start refreshing its session after 3 days no matter how long the session period issue. Previously the small peer would start to refresh after half of the session length had elapsed. (#9594, #9645)



Initial replication time by reducing one roundtrip of messages before peers can sync. (#9404)



Attachment fetch time in several edge case scenarios. (#9501)



Efficiency by using less system resources when connected to peers but no replication changes are needing to be sent. (#9479, #7995)



Significantly reduced startup resource consumption linked to total document count. (#9501)



A scenario where a peer could incorrectly receive data back from other peers even after they had modified their subscription and evicted the old data. (#9404)



An issue where unusually high replication write load in large meshes could block all readers from reading the database. (#9395, #8872)



The Connection type definition, which had previously contained a field named type that is now correctly defined with the name connectionType. (#9432)



The Address type definition, which had previously defined the siteId field to be of type string and has now been updated to define it with the correct number | BigInt type. (#9432)

==================================

Released: Tue Jul 18th 2023, 10:02 pm

Release Notes:

⚠️ Warning: This SDK version will migrate some data formats on disk. Once upgraded to 4.3.0, an SDK can only be downgraded back to 4.2.2 and 4.2.1 but no earlier. Downgrading to versions earlier than 4.2.1 will require uninstalling and re-installing to clear out the new data formats. (#8946)

* Added:

* Added:

* Added: An internal ability to measure & report the level of redundancy in replication updates to calculate the percentage of updates that are arriving from multiple peers. This will be used for future self-balancing mesh actions which are not yet enabled. (#8937)

* Changed: new serialization format improves efficiency of replication, particularly in the Big Peer. (#8946)

* Changed: Better logging for diagnosing auth failures. (#8984)

* Changed:  replication performance by introducing a small internal caching layer for commonly computed values. (#8777)

* Deprecated:

* Fixed: The replication engine can now recover from certain filesystem corruption issues during sync instead of panicking. (#8965)

* Fixed: Increased validation of document updates, preventing updates that try to modify the document id. (#9063)
