title: "Installing C++ SDK"
---

You can integrate the Ditto SDK into C++ projects to develop for Linux and iOS platforms.

<Info>
For a complete overview of the platforms, transports, and devices the C++ SDK supports, see [Compatibility with C++](<./Compatibility with C++.md>).
</Info>

To install the C++ SDK:

<Steps>
<Step>
Fetch and extract the Ditto package. ([Downloading and Unpacking Ditto]())&#x20;
</Step>

<Step>
Configure your app to link to the Ditto static library. ([Linking to Ditto]())
</Step>
</Steps>

# Downloading and Unpacking Ditto

Download `Ditto.tar.gz` and unpack an archive containing the `libditto.a` static library and `Ditto` header:

# Linking to Ditto

Add `-lditto` as a compilation step in the `main.cpp` source file:&#x20;

```curl
# This command assumes:
# You have unzipped the Ditto.tar.gz in a relative directory ./sdk/
# Your main code entry point is in ./src/main.cpp

g++ -std=c++17 ./src/main.cpp -I ./sdk -lditto -ldl -lrt -pthread -L ./sdk -o dist/main;

# Once executed, your output will be available at: ./dist/main

g++ -std=c++17 ./src/main.cpp -I ./sdk -lditto -ldl -framework Security,CoreFoundation,CoreBluetooth,ObjC -pthread -L ./sdk -o dist/main;

# Note: By adding the "-framework Security,CoreFoundation,CoreBluetooth,ObjC.," you enable the C++ SDK to leverage iOS peer-to-peer networks.

 # Once executed, your output will be available at: ./dist/main

# Importing Ditto

From the source code of your app, using `#include <Ditto.h>`, import Ditto and provide your access credentials:

<Info>
For instructions on how to obtain your access credentials, see [Onboarding](/v4-4/onboarding). For an introduction to authentication in Ditto, see *Ditto Basics* > [Authentication and Initialization](</v4-5/basics/authentication-and-initialization>).
</Info>

```cpp
auto identity =
    Identity::OnlinePlayground("YOUR_APP_ID", "PLAYGROUND_TOKEN", true);
try {
  Ditto ditto = Ditto(identity, dir);
  ditto.set_minimum_log_level(LogLevel::debug);
  ditto.start_sync();
} catch (const DittoError &err) {
}
```
