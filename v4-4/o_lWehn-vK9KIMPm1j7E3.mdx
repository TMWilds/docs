An issue introduced in 4.4.2 where the Small Peer Info attachments were not replicated to the Portal. (#10538)



Broken docs due to regression in upstream Rust nightly. (#10445)

### Rust Version 4.4.3[](#nfrRM)



Runtime validation of corrupted attachments being inserted into documents (#10552)



An issue introduced in 4.4.2 where the Small Peer Info attachments were not replicated to the Portal. (#10538)



Broken docs due to regression in upstream Rust nightly. (#10445)

### Rust Version 4.4.2[](#B8Gse)



Small Peer info collection now defaults to localPeerOnly, preventing data from being collected on the Big Peer until the feature is explicitly enabled and sync scope is set to bigPeerOnly. (#10203, #10204)

### Rust Version 4.4.1[](#OTpvR)

Synchronized version bump release - no changes

### Rust Version 4.4.0[](#GYD94)



Support for aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu llvm target CPU architecture. (#9162)

More informative log message for query failures caused by database access errors. (#9364)



Print some internal errors in a more human-readable format. (#9269)



TransportConfig and its associated types can be serialized/deserialized into/from JSON and CBOR. (#9585)



Sets a minimum session refresh period. The small peer will always try to start refreshing its session after 3 days no matter how long the session period issue. Previously the small peer would start to refresh after half of the session length had elapsed. (#9594, #9645)



Initial replication time by reducing one roundtrip of messages before peers can sync. (#9404)



Attachment fetch time in several edge case scenarios. (#9501)



Efficiency by using less system resources when connected to peers but no replication changes are needing to be sent. (#9479, #7995)



Significantly reduced startup resource consumption linked to total document count. (#9501)



Publish libdittoffi at the correct URL for arm64 Linux (#9694)

An issue where unusually high replication write load in large meshes could block all readers from reading the database. (#9395, #8872)



Attachment token encoding for cross-SDK attachment compatibility. This breaks backwards compatibility for attachment sync with peers using a version of the Rust SDK prior to 4.0.0 or 3.0.8. (#7762)

### Rust Version 4.3.0[](#GahnJ)

Released: Tue Jul 18th 2023, 10:02 pm

Release Notes:

⚠️ Warning: This SDK version will migrate some data formats on disk. Once upgraded to 4.3.0, an SDK can only be downgraded back to 4.2.2 and 4.2.1 but no earlier. Downgrading to versions earlier than 4.2.1 will require uninstalling and re-installing to clear out the new data formats. (#8946)

* Added: An internal ability to measure & report the level of redundancy in replication updates to calculate the percentage of updates that are arriving from multiple peers. This will be used for future self-balancing mesh actions which are not yet enabled. (#8937)

* Changed: new serialization format improves efficiency of replication, particularly in the Big Peer. (#8946)

* Changed: Better logging for diagnosing auth failures. (#8984)

* Changed:  replication performance by introducing a small internal caching layer for commonly computed values. (#8777)

* Fixed: The replication engine can now recover from certain filesystem corruption issues during sync instead of panicking. (#8965)

* Fixed: Increased validation of document updates, preventing updates that try to modify the document id. (#9063)
