title : "Ditto v4 for Java"
---

Java Version 4.5.0[](#DbQ0a)
============================

Released: Fri Dec 7, 2023



Performance by implementing bipartite distance-aware mesh topology. (#10632)



Memory usage and performance of Documents. (#10736)



Reduced metadata accumulation after eviction by clearing remote summaries. (#7065)



Serialization performance. (#9112)



Made logging more robust to failed writes in a specific set of circumstances. (#10077)



Addressed a warning from SQLite that sometimes occurs on startup about a schema change. (#10501)



Presence graph may not show all active connections. (#10507)



When observing peers, isConnectedToDittoCloud property may be incorrect. (#10534)



Initial logging events now use the same format as all other logs. (#10611)



Mesh could choose random connections. (#10711)



A bug with Ditto's internal crash handler. (#10022)

Java Version 4.4.5[](#ToNNH)
============================

Released: Fri Nov 17, 2023



SDK version/language/platform and device name are now included in the small peer info document. (#10515)

Java Version 4.4.4[](#f6szP)
============================

Released: Thur Nov 2, 2023



Runtime validation of corrupted attachments being inserted into documents (#10552)



An issue introduced in 4.4.2 where the Small Peer Info attachments were not replicated to the Portal. (#10538)

Java Version 4.4.3[](#-ZoV6)
============================

Released: Wed Nov 14, 2023



Runtime validation of corrupted attachments being inserted into documents (#10552)



An issue introduced in 4.4.2 where the Small Peer Info attachments were not replicated to the Portal. (#10538)

Java Version 4.4.2[](#ZL9Gh)
============================



Small Peer info collection now defaults to localPeerOnly, preventing data from being collected on the Big Peer until the feature is explicitly enabled and sync scope is set to bigPeerOnly. (#10203, #10204)



Fixed: DittoCollection.upsert() and DittoScopedWriteTransaction.upsert() are now annotated to indicate that they can throw a DittoError (#10109)

Java Version 4.4.1[](#k3Y-L)
============================



BLE connection reliability on Android 13. (#10005)

Java Android Version 4.4.0[](#SBshc)
====================================



New smallPeerInfo property to Ditto class for access to the single DittoSmallPeerInfo class instance. (#9704)



New DittoSmallPeerInfoSyncScope enum class. The smallPeerInfo collection's sync scope determines which "kind" of peers it will replicate to. Defaults to BigPeerOnly. (#9704, #9788)



New ValidationError and InternalError classes to help diagnose issues. (#9704)



More informative log message for query failures caused by database access errors. (#9364)



Small peers now persist structured log data to disk for later retrieval, with limits on the resulting disk usage. (#9547)



Print some internal errors in a more human-readable format. (#9269)



TransportConfig and its associated types can be serialized/deserialized into/from JSON and CBOR. (#9585)



Sets a minimum session refresh period. The small peer will always try to start refreshing its session after 3 days no matter how long the session period issue. Previously the small peer would start to refresh after half of the session length had elapsed. (#9594, #9645)



Initial replication time by reducing one roundtrip of messages before peers can sync. (#9404)



Attachment fetch time in several edge case scenarios. (#9501)



efficiency by using less system resources when connected to peers but no replication changes are needing to be sent. (#9479, #7995)



Significantly reduced startup resource consumption linked to total document count. (#9501)



A scenario where a peer could incorrectly receive data back from other peers even after they had modified their subscription and evicted the old data. (#9404)



An issue where unusually high replication write load in large meshes could block all readers from reading the database. (#9395, #8872)"

====================================

Released: Tue Jul 18th 2023, 10:02 pm

Release Notes:

⚠️ Warning: This SDK version will migrate some data formats on disk. Once upgraded to 4.3.0, an SDK can only be downgraded back to 4.2.2 and 4.2.1 but no earlier. Downgrading to versions earlier than 4.2.1 will require uninstalling and re-installing to clear out the new data formats. (#8946)

* Added: Nullable

* Added: An internal ability to measure & report the level of redundancy in replication updates to calculate the percentage of updates that are arriving from multiple peers. This will be used for future self-balancing mesh actions which are not yet enabled. (#8937)

* Changed: new serialization format improves efficiency of replication, particularly in the Big Peer. (#8946)

* Changed: Better logging for diagnosing auth failures. (#8984)

* Changed:  replication performance by introducing a small internal caching layer for commonly computed values. (#8777)

* Fixed: The replication engine can now recover from certain filesystem corruption issues during sync instead of panicking. (#8965)

* Fixed: Increased validation of document updates, preventing updates that try to modify the document id. (#9063)
