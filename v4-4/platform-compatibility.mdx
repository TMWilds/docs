### Objective-C

Ditto does not offer native support for apps developed in Objective-C.

If you want to use the Ditto SDK for Swift with an Objective-C app, you must use a bridge to integrate.

For a code walkthrough on how to create a bridge that calls into Swift from Objective-C, see the getditto > [example-swift-bridge-to-objectivec](https://github.com/getditto/example-swift-bridge-to-objectivec "example-swift-bridge-to-objectivec") repository in GitHub.

## JavaScript SDK Compatibility


The Ditto SDK for JavaScript is versatile, capable of operating in various environments including the browser, Node.js, (and Electron).

Support for React Native in the Ditto SDK for JavaScript is currently in development and will be available soon. For an overview of support once released, see [React Native Support](/v4-4/compatibility-with-javascript#ZAR6d).

### Node.js Support

The following provides a complete overview of the Ditto SDK's compatibility across platforms, transports, and devices:

If you're using Electron to develop a Windows-based app, you may need to install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable.

For more information, see the official Microsoft documentation > [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable latest supported downloads](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170 "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable latest supported downloads").
