title: Query Syntax
description: "At a high-level, queries operate on collections rather than individual documents. Filter, search, and retrieve specific information based on various criteria using Boolean operators, equal and unequal operators, comparison operators, and match operators."

This article includes an overview of operators and path navigations for building advanced queries in your app, along with real-world examples.

# Boolean Operators

When a field property is a boolean data type, use explicit true-false values.&#x20;

<Info>
Enclose groups of logical operations with parentheses to ensure Ditto interprets your desired logic correctly.
</Info>

For example, to find documents with an `"isDeleted"` boolean property set to `"true"`:


```sql Query
"isDeleted == true"
```

To find documents with an `"isDeleted"` boolean property set to `"false"`:

```sql Query
"isDeleted == false"
```


# Equal (==) and Inequality (!=) Operators

To find documents that match a given key-value pair, use the equal operator. Where you specify the key and the number or string value you want to match separated by `==`.&#x20;

For example, to find documents that have a title equal to `"Harry Potter"`:


```sql Query
"title == 'Harry Potter'"
```


If, instead of finding documents that match, you want to find documents that do *not *match a given key-value pair, use the inequality operator. Where you specify the key and the value that you don’t want to match separated by `!=`.&#x20;

For example, to find documents that are not of the title "Lord of the Rings":


```sql Query
"title != 'Lord of the Rings'"
```


# Comparison Operators: (>=)(>)(\<=)(\<)

Compare values in documents, set conditions, retrieve specific documents that meet your criteria, and make logical evaluations using the following operators in your query statements.

<Info>
Ditto supports parsing ISO-8601 date strings, so you can use ISO-8601 formatted date strings in queries for comparison operations. For more information, see [Using ISO-8601 for Date Strings](<./CRUD Operations.md>).
</Info>

For example:

To find documents where `age` field property is less than or equal to the value of `18`:

```sql Query
"age <= 18"
```


To find documents where the `age` field property is less than the value of `18`:

```sql Query
"age < 18"
```


To find documents where the `age` field property is greater than or equal to the value of `18`:

```sql Query
"age >= 18"
```


To find documents where the `age` field property is greater than the value of `18`:

```sql Query
"age > 18"
```


# Compound Operators

Perform complex operations in a single executable by using *compound operators*. A compound operator* *is a combination of two or more operators in a single executable:&#x20;

| **SQL**       | **Ditto**   |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `AND`         | `&&`        |
| `OR`          | `\|\|`      |
| `NOT`         | `!`         |
| `contains( )` | contains( ) |

## Logical AND Predicate Statements: (&&)

Similar to SQL `AND` statements, use `&&` for a condition that evaluates to true only when *all *of its conditions are set to `true`.

For example, to find documents that have a `theme` field property equal to `"Dark"` and a name field property equal to `"Light"`:


```sql Query
"theme == 'Dark' && name == 'Light'
```


## Logical OR Statements: (||)

Similar to SQL `OR` statements, use `||`** **for a logical *or*** **predicate statement.

For example, to find documents that are `"Tom"` or `"Arthur"`:


```sql Query
"name == 'Tom' || name == 'Arthur'"
```


## Logical NOT Statements: (!)

Similar to SQL `NOT` statements, use `!` for logical *not* predicate statements:

For example, find documents that are neither "Hamilton" nor "Morten":

```sql Query
"name != 'Tom'"
```


## String Operations

Use `starts_with(property, test)` to test if a field property with a string value starts with a test string.

For example, to find documents with a `title` field property that *begins* with `"Lord"`:

```sql Query
"starts_with(title, 'Lord')"
```


Use `ends_with(property, test)` to test if a field property with a string value *ends* with a test string.&#x20;

For example, to find documents with a `title` field property that ends with `"Rings"`:

```sql Query
"ends_with(title, 'Rings')"
```


Use `regex(property, test)` to see if a field property with a string value passes a regular expression. For more information, see the official Mozilla Developer Network Docs (MDN) > <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions" target="_blank">Regular Expressions</a>.

For example, to find documents containing only upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores:


```sql Query
"regex(title, '^([A-Za-z]|[0-9]|_)+$')"

// A title property of "abc129_24A" will pass
// A title property of "abc129_24A  3" will not pass
```


# NULL Values

Use `null` to check for the existence of a value of a given field.

For example, to find documents with a `color` field property that has no value:

```sql Query
"color == null"
```


# Array Operators

When handling collections of data that different peers may make concurrent updates to, first consider using an embedded `map` structure. If necessary, use an `array`.&#x20;

The `array` type in Ditto is a CRDT and behaves differently than the primitive `array` type. For more information, see the *Platform Manual *> [Data Types](<./Data Types.md>).



| **Operator**             | **Operation**                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `contains(array, value)` | Checks for value in the `array` |


```sql Query
"contains(['blue', 'green'], color)"
```


# Date and Time Formats

When parsing date and time strings, use the ISO-8601 standard format, as follows.&#x20;

For more information, see *Platform Manual *> [Using ISO-8601 for Date Strings](<./CRUD Operations/Best Practices for CRUD.md>).


```sql Query
"created_at >= '2022-04-29T00:55:31.859Z'"
```


# Field Path Navigation

If fields consist of alphanumeric characters or include underscores, use any of the following notations to navigate document properties.&#x20;

- For fields that are alphanumeric or include underscores, use dot notation:&#x20;


```sql Query
"name.last == 'Turing'"
```


- For all other scenarios, use bracket notation:

```sql Query
"work['street-line'] == '678 Johnson Street'"
```
