title : Sync Overview
---

Data consistency and integrity is the foundation of any data management system, particularly in distributed systems such as Ditto.

This article offers a brief overview of how interconnected peers communicate and collaborate quickly, continuously, and reliably across the system, even in the presence of network failures.

For comprehensive information, see the _Platform Manual_:

- [Sync and Replication Concepts](<./../Platform Manual/Sync and Replication Concepts.md>)

## Delta-Encoded Sync&#x20;

Data in Ditto is *delta encoded. *That is, when peer-to-peer syncing, instead of transmitting entire datasets, only changes (delta) are retrieved, sent, or locally stored.

The key advantages to Ditto's delta-based approach include:

- Highly frequent and efficient data transmission\*\* \*\*— Avoiding redundant data transmission and reducing bandwidth consumption optimizes network performance.

- Consistency without centralized coordination — Distributed peers do not need to reach consensus to converge and merge a single value without conflict. &#x20;

## Sync, Partition, and Replication

However, data sync goes beyond basic updates and involves sophisticated techniques like _partitioning_ and _replication_:\* \*

- Partitioning is a strategy that involves dividing the data into smaller, more manageable pieces called _partitions_. &#x20;

- These partitions are then asynchronously copied across connected Small Peers. That is, the copies of the data, or _replicas_, are distributed across separate storage locations running locally within an end-user's physical environment, such as a mobile device.

Partitioning and replication are central to ensuring rapid and dependable data access for your end users.

### Multiplexer for Intelligent Replication

Ditto incorporates a *multiplexer *inside the peer-to-peer mesh network to facilitate the data replication process.&#x20;

Developed by Ditto, the multiplexer is an intelligent replication machine that seamlessly switches between active transport types as needed, without duplicating data.

In addition, the multiplexer breaks data packets down into small fragments and then, once received on the other side, reassembles them.

When the transports collaborate in parallel and the multiplexer automatically switches between them to establish the most optimal connection, these diverse transport types collectively form what is known as the _rainbow connection _— each color of the rainbow symbolizes a different transport type:

## Conflict-Free Replication

In Ditto's decentralized architecture, data propagates asynchronously among offline peers, eliminating the need for a centralized authority like a central server to validate and merge database operations.

This decentralized model, however, presents the possibility of _concurrency conflicts_. A concurrency conflict happens when multiple end users make changes to the same data items at the same time. When merging these changes, any inconsistencies collide.&#x20;

To resolve these concurrency conflicts, as well as enable optimizations like delta-based replication, Ditto harnesses conflict-free replicated data type (_CRDT_) technology. CRDT is an advanced class of data type designed to manage and replicate data changes in a way that allows multiple distributed peers to make updates concurrently without the need to reach a consensus to form a single meaningful value for merge.

For an overview of the different CRDTs that Ditto offers, see [Data Structures and Types](<./Data Structures and Types.md>).&#x20;

## Communication Transports

Ditto’s peer-to-peer network architecture utilizes the following diverse set of communication transport technologies and communication channels to achieve seamless, offline-first connections between devices:

- [Bluetooth Low Energy]()
- [Peer-to-Peer Wi-Fi]()
- [Local Area Network]()
- [WebSockets]()

By leveraging a diverse set of technologies, Ditto supports a variety of use cases, devices, and environments.

<Info>
By default, peers use all available transports available to their devices. For instructions on how to enable and disable transports, see the *Platform Manual *> [Transports](<./../Platform Manual/Transports.md>) > [Configuring Transports](<./../Platform Manual/Transports/Configuring Transports.md>).
</Info>

### Bluetooth Low Energy

The following video provides a brief visual overview of how Ditto uses Bluetooth LE to form low-powered high-distance connections between devices.

<Info>
The distances and bandwidth limitations and capacities illustrated in the video are approximations and vary depending on the Bluetooth® firmware installed on the device.&#x20;

### Peer-to-Peer Wi-Fi

Available on most devices, standard peer-to-peer Wi-Fi enables direct, point-to-point connections between peers without requiring traditional network infrastructure like a centralized server, router, or access point.

In addition to standard peer-to-peer Wi-Fi, Ditto incorporates a customized multiplexer to increase frequency, speed, and efficiency of data transmission between peers connected in the mesh network.&#x20;

The following table provides an overview of the Wi-Fi technologies Ditto supports:

The following video illustrates Ditto’s sophisticated and decentralized approach to peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections between distributed peers connected in the mesh network:

<Info>
The maximum distance of a connection can vary depending on the specific peer-to-peer transport type being used.

### Local Area Network

<Info>
For detailed information, see *Platform Manual *> [Local Area Network](<./../Platform Manual/Transports.md>).
</Info>

### WebSockets

Peers use _WebSocket_ connections to enable realtime, bidirectional sync between Small Peers and the cloud deployment, the _Big Peer._

<Info>
Before you can establish a connection with the Big Peer using a WebSocket, you need to specify an IP/PORT. For instructions, see *Platform Manual *> [Configuring Transports](<./../Platform Manual/Transports/Configuring Transports.md>).
</Info>

The defining attributes of a WebSocket include:

- Requires an internet connection to establish peer-to-peer communication.

- Unlike the other peer-to-peer transport types, does not automatically discover other peers physically nearby.

- WebSocket connections can be made over a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or Local Area Network (LAN).

<Info>
For detailed information, see *Platform Manual *> [WebSockets](<./../Platform Manual/Transports.md>).
</Info>

### Universal Serial Bus

When active and granted permission for universal serial bus (USB) communication, peers can establish a direct, wired connection by way of a USB connection.
