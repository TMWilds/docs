# DittoSwift Version 2.0.0Released: Wed Aug 3, 2022, 7:54 am



Note: peers running 2.0.0 are able to sync with peers running at least version 1.1.8 of the SDK.



Added: support for explicitly typing values as registers. This is via 2 new types: DittoRegister and DittoMutableRegister, and new registerValue value accessors  to DittoDocumentPath and DittoMutableDocumentPath.



Added: DittoCounter and DittoMutableCounter types resembling the CRDT type underneath, which replace the old counter mechanics. A new counter value accessor has been  to DittoDocumentPath and DittoMutableDocumentPath, which returns a DittoCounter or a DittoMutableCounter respectively, if one is present at the document path specified.



Added: support for accessing and creating RGAs (Replicated Growable Arrays), which was the default CRDT type for arrays in Ditto v1. There are 2 new types: DittoRGA and DittoMutableRGA in v2, and new rga value accessors  to DittoDocumentPath and DittoMutableDocumentPath. Note that these are deprecated though and arrays should instead be used in registers (which is now the default).



Changed: arrays now default to being Register arrays. This means that when you want to update a property in a document that's an array you need to set the whole value as the new array. You can't perform mutating operations on an array in a document other than to fully replace it.



Added: value accessor properties have been  to DittoDocumentID: value, string{Value}, bool{Value}, int{Value}, uint{Value}, float{Value}, double{Value}, array{Value}, dictionary{Value}.



Changed: the keys DittoAccessLicense and DittoLicenseToken in Info.plist will now fail with a fatal error instead of logging a deprecation warning. Please use the key DittoOfflineOnlyLicenseToken instead.



Changed: renamed identity onlinePlaygroundV2 to just onlinePlayground, which replaces the previously deprecated onlinePlayground.



Changed: renamed Ditto method tryStartSync() to just startSync(), which replaces the previously deprecated startSync().



Removed: deprecated DittoRemotePeerV2 property meshRole, please queryOverlapGroup instead.



Removed: deprecated type DittoPeersObserver, please use DittoObserver instead.



Removed: deprecated DittoDocumentID method toNative(), please use property value instead.



Removed: deprecated DittoScopedWriteTransaction method find(query:), please use find() instead.



Removed: deprecated DittoScopedWriteTransaction methods insert() and insertWithStrategy(), please use upsert() and upsertWithStrategy() instead.



Removed: deprecated DittoCollection methods insert() and insertWithStrategy(), please use upsert() and upsertWithStrategy() instead.



Removed: deprecated identities development and online, please use the available ones instead.



Removed: deprecated Ditto methods setAccessLicense() and setLicenseToken(), please use setOfflineOnlyLicenseToken() instead.



Removed: deprecated Ditto method setTransportConfig(), please set the transportConfig property directly.



Removed: deprecated DittoAuthenticator method isAuthenticated() and property userID, please use status instead.



Removed: DittoWriteStrategy.overwrite.
