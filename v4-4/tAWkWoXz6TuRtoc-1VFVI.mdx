description: "The conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT) data structure enables smooth peer‑to‑peer offline replication and online sync in distributed systems."
---

When multiple offline Ditto stores make concurrent updates to the same CRDT object, the CRDT merge mechanism remediates the data collision so that, when sync takes place, they converge to a consistent state. For more information, see the _Platform Manual_ \> [Sync and Replication Concepts](#Vh2a6OTl4DLnEl0A-mIU8).

Following are the types of CRDTs you can use in Ditto:

## Supported Types Overview


The following table provides a quick overview of the advanced data types you can use in Ditto, along with their guiding principles for conflict resolution, or _merge semantics_, a brief description, and a common usage scenario:

| **Type** | **Merge Semantics** | **Description** | **Use Case** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| register | Last‑Write‑Wins Register, <br/><br/>Delta-state replication | Stores a single value and allows for concurrent updates. | Updates associated with later temporal timestamps _always_ win. |
| map | Add-Wins Map,<br/><br/>Delta-state replication | Working in conjunction with the Register, stores the mapping of temporal timestamps to the values written in the Register to help resolve concurrency conflicts. | Make a list of items in a document and update those items over time. |
| counter | Positive or Negative Counter,<br/><br/>The sum of all Site_ID Counters,<br/><br/>Delta-state replication | Converts a number value for a given key into a Counter.<br/><br/>Unlike a primitive number, value increments and decrements merge without conflict. | Manage inventory and handle votes, such as stock details and survey results. |
| attachment | Last-Write‑Wins Register,<br/><br/>Merges only when explicitly fetched | Stores very large amounts of binary data, such as an image file, and allows for concurrent updates. | Reduce Small Peer resource usage by storing data outside of memory. |
| array | Last‑Write‑Wins Register,<br/><br/>Delta-state replication | An extension of the register type, |     |

## Update Behavior by Type

The following table provides an overview of the CRDTs and associated behavior for a given operation:

For more information, see [CRUD Operations](/v4-4/V5eBeM0ww-xU1B4tE8Czc).

| **Operation** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| set register | Sets the value for a given field in the document. |
| set map | Sets value for a given field in the map. |
| remove register | Removes a value for a given field in the document. |
| remove map | Removes a value for a given key in the map structure. |
| replace with counter | Converts a number value for a given field into a counter. |
| increment counter | Unlike a number, increments the counter by the given positive integer value. |
| decrement counter | Unlike a number, decrements the counter by the given negative integer value. |
