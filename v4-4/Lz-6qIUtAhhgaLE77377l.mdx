title: Evaluation Criteria
---
The decision to use deeply embedded `maps` in a single document or opt for a flat model instead depends on your specific requirements, relationships between data, and tolerance for certain tradeoffs.&#x20;

<Info>
The flat model is a simple, nonâ€‘embedded structure in which you spread your data across multiple separate documents. For more information, see [Relationships](/v4-4/sYl9cRetVk5AmaWx_Iav0) > [Good Pattern: Flat Models](/v4-4/sYl9cRetVk5AmaWx_Iav0).

When assessing whether to embed `maps` in a document or distribute the data across multiple smaller documents, refer to the following criteria to guide you:&#x20;

- [Data Complexity]()
- [Query Performance]()
- [Data Size]()
- [Concurrency]()
- [Document Structure]()
- [Scalability]()

# Data Complexity

The following table provides criteria for the levels of complexity in your data model:&#x20;

| **Criteria**                                                                      | **Model** |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| You have a clear relationship between data items stored together in a collection. | Embedded  |
| Your data items are relatively simple and do not need a strong relationship.      | Flat      |

# Query Performance

The following table provides criteria for the speed and efficiency of read and write operations:&#x20;

| **Criteria**                                                         | **Model** |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| You frequently retrieve or update the embedded `map` items together. | Embedded  |
| You frequently access or modify only certain parts of the data.      | Flat      |

# Data Size

The following table provides criteria for the potential size of the embedded `map`:

<Warning>
Syncing large documents can significantly impact network performance:

Caution is advised when handling large binary data, such as a high-resolution image or video exceeding 50 megapixels; a deeply embedded document; or a very large document.

Instead of storing files exceeding 250kb directly within a document object, carefully consider using `attachments` . For more information, see [Data Types](</v4-4/tAWkWoXz6TuRtoc-1VFVI>) > [Attachment](<./../Data Types/Attachment.md>).

</Warning>

| **Criteria**                                                                                                                                                  | **Model** |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| You do not anticipate the embedded `map` to become too large and potentially impact overall system performance.                                               | Embedded  |
| You anticipate the embedded `map` to increase in complexity and size and therefore become difficult to manage and so large that system performance degrades.  | Flat      |

# Concurrency

The following table provides criteria for the potential for concurrent edits and resulting merge conflicts:

| **Criteria**                                                                                                                                          | **Model** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| It is very likely that your end users will modify the same data items stored locally on their respective environments while internet is unavailable.  | Embedded  |
| It is *not *likely that your end users will modify the same data items stored locally on their respective environments while internet is unavailable. | Flat      |

# Document Structure

The following table provides a criteria for assessing the overall structure of your documents:

| **Criteria**                                                                                                                                                                | **Model** |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Your embedded `maps` are relatively simple in structure and do not require maintainability over time.                                                                       | Embedded  |
| Multiple embedded `maps` are becoming *deeply* nested; as in you have an embedded map representing three or more levels in a hierarchy, necessitating better organization.  | Flat      |

# Scalability

The following table provides criteria for assessing how your data model may evolve over time:&#x20;

| **Criteria**                                                                              | **Model** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| You anticipate that you'll add more data or expand relationships in the future.           | Embedded  |
| You do *not *anticipate that you'll add more data or expand relationships in the future.  | Flat      |
