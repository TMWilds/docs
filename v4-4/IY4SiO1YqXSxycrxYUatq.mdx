New smallPeerInfo property to Ditto class for access to the single DittoSmallPeerInfo class instance. (#9704)



New DittoSmallPeerInfoSyncScope enum class. The smallPeerInfo collection's sync scope determines which "kind" of peers it will replicate to. Defaults to BigPeerOnly. (#9704, #9788)



New ValidationError and InternalError classes to help diagnose issues. (#9704)



More informative log message for query failures caused by database access errors. (#9364)



Small peers now persist structured log data to disk for later retrieval, with limits on the resulting disk usage. (#9547)

TransportConfig and its associated types can be serialized/deserialized into/from JSON and CBOR. (#9585)



Sets a minimum session refresh period. The small peer will always try to start refreshing its session after 3 days no matter how long the session period issue. Previously the small peer would start to refresh after half of the session length had elapsed. (#9594, #9645)



Initial replication time by reducing one roundtrip of messages before peers can sync. (#9404)



Attachment fetch time in several edge case scenarios. (#9501)



efficiency by using less system resources when connected to peers but no replication changes are needing to be sent. (#9479, #7995)

1implementation "live.ditto:ditto:4.3.1"



Kotlin Android Version 4.3.0[](#a3fS8)
======================================

This SDK version will migrate some data formats on disk. Once upgraded to 4.3.0, an SDK can only be downgraded back to 4.2.2 and 4.2.1 but no earlier. Downgrading to versions earlier than 4.2.1 will require uninstalling and re-installing to clear out the new data formats. (#8946)

Released: Tue Jul 18, 2023, 10:02 pm



Added: Nullable



Added: An internal ability to measure & report the level of redundancy in replication updates to calculate the percentage of updates that are arriving from multiple peers. This will be used for future self-balancing mesh actions which are not yet enabled. (#8937)



Changed: new serialization format improves efficiency of replication, particularly in the Big Peer. (#8946)



Changed: Better logging for diagnosing auth failures. (#8984)



Changed:  replication performance by introducing a small internal caching layer for commonly computed values. (#8777)

Kotlin Android Version 4.2.0[](#8uDKC)
======================================

Released: Tue Jun 13th 2023, 1:53 am



Added: Experimental support for disk encryption. This API is experimental for the time being and is likely to change in the next couple of releases. (#8847)



Added: login method that provides an extra String? argument (as compared to loginWithToken) that will be non-nil if the auth webhook provided any clientInfo JSON value. The String will be a JSON encoded string. (#8787)



Changed: the existing loginWithToken is marked as deprecated. (#8787)



Changed:  replication uses compressed message stream to decrease bandwidth consumption. (#8807)



Changed: Reduce verbosity in replication logs (#8370)



Changed:  support for IPv6 Wi-Fi Aware connections (#8518)

Fixed: Crash when logging out.

installation

1implementation "live.ditto:ditto:4.1.1"



Kotlin Android Version 4.1.0[](#20xv6)
======================================

Released: Fri Apr 28th 2023, 11:52 am



Added: Disabled replication state. When the Big Peer receives a query that is too big to be satisfied, it will explicitly disable replication with the remote peer, and send a message informing the remote peer that replication is disabled. This is in contrast to the previous behavior, where the Big Peer simply did not respond to the query.



Changed: DittoSyncPermissions.contextis now optional for compatibility with Compose apps, which should leverage the Accompanist library for doing permissions check & request



Changed: Ditto instances cannot be closed/deallocated from within a live query callback closure otherwise this can lead to a deadlock.



Changed: (Experimental) Query Overlap Groups, Bus: a breaking protocol change for upcoming improvements. Peers using older versions will not be able to connect with newer peers until they upgrade.



Fixed:  stability when transferring large updates over Bluetooth LE



Fixed: A replication issue where certain cases that should have reset the replication session with a remote peer would instead temporarily terminate the connection while not resetting the session.



Fixed: A replication issue that could cause failed convergence on small number of documents if updates are being received during a local eviction.



Security: Enforce immediate disconnection of any connected peers whose certificate expires during a sync session.

Kotlin Android Version 4.0.0[](#z-RZ4)
======================================

Released: Wed Mar 22nd 2023, 3:48 pm



Added: AddWins removes will now be used if disableSyncWithV3 has been called on the Ditto object or the a peer has synced with another peer that has called disableSyncWithV3, or they have synced with another peer that has called disableSyncWithV3, etc.



Changed: If a problem occurs with an app's authentication webhook, the Small Peer that is trying to authenticate will log more detailed information for the developer.



Changed: old multi-hop connections are now automatically disconnected when direct connections are established with peers, freeing up unneeded resources faster.



Changed: reduced severity level for some routine log statements which were previously emitted at a WARN level.



Fixed: some threads spawned by the SDK no longer wait up to 30 seconds before being stopped.



Fixed: an issue which could cause Ditto to hang if more than 500 peers were encountered.



Fixed: replication hanging under some circumstances, especially WebSocket connections to Big Peer



Fixed: potential crash when stopping and restarting WiFi transport very rapidly



Fixed: attempt to sync with the cloud before the user requests it with

Kotlin Android Version 4.0.0-alpha2[](#eZWNj)
=============================================

Released: Mon Jan 16th 2023, 2:16 pm



Added: disableSyncWithV3 functionality to Ditto. Calling this will permanently remove the ability for the device that it is called on to sync with devices running v3 of the SDK. It also means that the device will then start performing AddWins removes when calling remove(). Any other device running v4 of the SDK that syncs with a device that has called disableSyncWithV3 (or has themselves synced with another device that has called disableSyncWithV3, etc - if any chain of syncing exists that involves a device that has called disableSyncWithV3) will also no longer be able to sync with v3 peers and will perform AddWins removes when calling remove().
