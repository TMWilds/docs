title: Fields and Key-Values
---

A document consists of sets of fields that self-describe the data it encodes. Each set signifies a single pair of two associated elements:

* The name identifying the data. ([Field Property](undefined#Li4_b))

* The value that holds the actual data to store. ([Field Values](undefined#OIk42))


Required and randomly generated and assigned by default upon creation, the first set of fields identify the document. For more information, see [Identifier: Default and Custom](#67wjvNr54pFMMAE2WRe3S), as follows.

# Field Property

Similar to most document-oriented databases, you can only use `strings` to encode field names in documents.&#x20;

<Warning>
If you attempt to insert a type other than a string for a field property, as demonstrated in the following snippet, you will receive an error message:
</Warning>

```none
{
    1: "numeric_fields_are_invalid_here",
    "this_part": "numeric_fields_are_valid_here"
}
```

# Field Values

Values can be encoded using various data types, providing flexibility in representing a wide range of information; however, the supported data types depend on the type of CRDT you are using:

- For a `register`, use any type: such as `strings`, `numbers`, `objects`, or even binary data.&#x20;

- For a `counter`, use only a `number`.&#x20;

- If embedding a `map`, use key-value pairs within the embedded structure.&#x20;

<Info>
For an overview of write behavior by type, see [Data Types](</v4-4/tAWkWoXz6TuRtoc-1VFVI>).

## Sorting by Field

Sort the results in a specific order by using the Sort method to specify the field for matching and the desired order of the matching query results.

<Info>
By default, queries that do not include a sort operation, filter by document ID.
</Info>

## Limiting by Field

Restrict the number of results returned by your query by using the limit method to specify the number of results you want to return.

# Map Key-Value Pairs

Establishes a parent-child hierarchy between data elements where the key serves as the parent and the associated values for the children to link related data items as well as organize them in a structure that enhances the efficiency of lookup.
