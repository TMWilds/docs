# Java Version 4.5.0
If you are upgrading from v4.x to v4.5 without adopting any new functionality there will be no changes required and all other v4.x devices will sync with v4.5 devices.

v4.5 follows semver and is backwards compatible with all previous v4 versions. All changes in v4.5 are additive and donâ€™t require any additional work when upgrading.

If you plan on adopting DQL as part of the migration to v4.5 review [Legacy-to-DQL Adoption Guide](https://docs.ditto.live/v4-5/#e2ZbKPkQwYMyXW5pN4rjM)

***Note:*** All existing APIs and queries (eg. find , findById , observe , ect.) will remain supported for the foreseeable future. We will notify customers with advanced warning when we plan to end of life these APIs.

**Added**

- VERSION static property to the Ditto class. (#10223)
- DittoError.FatalError data class. (#10536)
- DittoStore.execute() method for querying the store using the new Ditto Query Language. (#8354)
- DittoSyncSubscription class for managing sync subscriptions. (#8354, #10536)
- DittoSync class whose registerSubscription() method allows for controlling sync using Ditto Query Language. (#8354, #10536)
- registerObserver() method to the DittoStore class. (#8354, #10536)

**Deprecated**

- DittoLanConfig.multicastEnabled property. (#10126)
- DittoError.InternalErrorReason data class. These very unlikely exceptions will be thrown as FatalError instea. (#10536)

**Changed**

- Failure to load the Ditto native binary now throws a FatalError instead of aborting the process. (#10015)
- DittoError.FailedToEncodeValue.error has been replaced with FailedToEncodeValue.message which is a simple string type, reducing API dependency on Jackson/FasterXML. (#10536

**Improved**

- Performance by implementing bipartite distance-aware mesh topology. (#10632)
- Memory usage and performance of Documents. (#10736)
