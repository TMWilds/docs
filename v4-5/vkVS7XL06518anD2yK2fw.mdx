### C# Version 4.4.2[](#ShOX5)

### C# / .NET Version 4.3.0[](#sTm2J)

Released: Tue Jul 18th 2023, 10:02 pm

Release Notes:

⚠️ Warning: This SDK version will migrate some data formats on disk. Once upgraded to 4.3.0, an SDK can only be downgraded back to 4.2.2 and 4.2.1 but no earlier. Downgrading to versions earlier than 4.2.1 will require uninstalling and re-installing to clear out the new data formats. (#8946)

* Added: An internal ability to measure & report the level of redundancy in replication updates to calculate the percentage of updates that are arriving from multiple peers. This will be used for future self-balancing mesh actions which are not yet enabled. (#8937)

* Changed: new serialization format improves efficiency of replication, particularly in the Big Peer. (#8946)

* Changed: Better logging for diagnosing auth failures. (#8984)

* Changed:  replication performance by introducing a small internal caching layer for commonly computed values. (#8777)

* Fixed: The replication engine can now recover from certain filesystem corruption issues during sync instead of panicking. (#8965)

* Fixed: Increased validation of document updates, preventing updates that try to modify the document id. (#9063)
