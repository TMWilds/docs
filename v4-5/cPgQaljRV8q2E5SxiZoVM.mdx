- Deprecated **startSync** and added a new function, **tryStartSync**, which will throw an error if your **Ditto** instance hasn't yet been activated via a successful call to **setLicenseToken**.

If you have existing data that you need to keep then please contact us and we can advise you as to how you can migrate your data.
- The most notable API breaking changes are:
