It includes features like realtime collaboration, location sharing, and built‑in asset file storage capabilities.<br/><br/>A maintenance app enhances operational efficiency and safety in any environment where maintenance is a core function. For instance, industrial settings like manufacturing, transportation and logistics, waste management, water treatment, food processing, upon various other industrial settings; as well as non‑industrial settings, such as commercial buildings, residential complexes, and institutions. |
