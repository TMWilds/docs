There are several methods for linking related data items and organizing them for easy lookup:

- Field referencing another document by `_id`.
- Embedded JSON object that acts as a `REGISTER` type or an embedded `MAP`.

## Overview

The following table provides a complete overview of the different relationships you can form in Ditto, as well as a brief description, list of possible approaches you can take, and links to related content:

| **Relationship** | **Description** | **Approaches** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One-to-many | Associates a parent element with children elements to establish a hierarchy. | * Embed a JSON object (REGISTER)<br/>    <br/>* Embed a MAP<br/>    <br/>* Reference a field to a document<br/>    <br/>* Reference a document to a collection |
| Many-to-many | Associates multiple entities in one collection with multiple entities in another collection. | * Embed a JSON object (REGISTER)<br/>    <br/>* Embed a MAP<br/>    <br/>* Create references between documents in different collections |
| Many-to-one | Associates two or more collections, where one collection refers to the primary key of another collection to create a meaningful relationship between the datasets. | * Embed a JSON object (REGISTER)<br/>    <br/>* Embed a MAP<br/>    <br/>* Create references between documents in different collections |
<Warning>
Avoid using `arrays` in Ditto.

Due to potential merge conflicts when offline peers reconnect to the mesh and attempt to sync their updates, especially when multiple peers make concurrent updates to the same item within the` array`.
</Warning>
## Foreign-Key Relationships

To create a *foreign-key relationship*, store the primary key to one document within another document.

A foreign-key relationship establishes a link between two or more datasets. For example, if you have two collections, `cars` and `owners`, where each car has a corresponding owner, every document in the `cars` collection would include a field containing the ID of a document in the `owners` collection.

## Key-Value Relationships

A *key-value relationship *establishes a parent-child hierarchy between embedded data elements. In this hierarchy, the key functions as the parent, and its encapsulated values, represented as a set of key-value pairs, serve as children.


When managing data that requires unique identifiers and relationships, instead of using an `array` to encode your data, use a `MAP` with unique string keys and object values instead.
