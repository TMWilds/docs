# Version 4.5.0If you are upgrading from v4.x to v4.5 without adopting any new functionality there will be no changes required and all other v4.x devices will sync with v4.5 devices.

v4.5 follows semver and is backwards compatible with all previous v4 versions. All changes in v4.5 are additive and don’t require any additional work when upgrading.

If you plan on adopting DQL as part of the migration to v4.5 review [Legacy-to-DQL Adoption Guide](https://docs.ditto.live/v4-5/js/#e2ZbKPkQwYMyXW5pN4rjM)﻿﻿

***Note:*** All existing APIs and queries (eg. find , findById , observe , ect.) will remain supported for the foreseeable future. We will notify customers with advanced warning when we plan to end of life these APIs.
