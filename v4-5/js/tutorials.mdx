¹If using OnlineWithAuthentication, you are required to integrate a third-party identity provider with your app.

<Info>
Auth0 is Ditto’s preferred third-party identity service provider; however, you can use any you prefer. If you are using a third-party service provider other than Auth0, refer to your provider’s official documentation in addition to this tutorial as needed.
