title : "Node.js Task App Quickstart"
---

To get started right away without having to build an app from scratch, explore with the Ditto ready-to-use demo task app.

# Prerequisites
Before you can install Ditto, you must have the following:

- Ditto access credentials
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js") active long-term support (LTS) version 18.x or 20.x
- Linux, macOS version 11 (or later), or Windows version 10 (or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Git")
- Integrated developer environment (IDE)

- To get your access credentials, complete the [Onboarding](https://docs.ditto.live/v4-5/onboarding)ï»¿.
- You can use any IDE you prefer; however, for optimal compatibility with the platform, Ditto recommends using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download "Visual Studio Code").

# Installing the Demo Task App
To install Ditto in your environment, install and set up Ditto, and authenticate your client identity with the Big Peer:

1. Clone the [getditto > template-app-nodejs-todo](https://github.com/getditto/template-app-nodejs-todo/ "getditto > template-app-nodejs-todo") repository from GitHub:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/getditto/template-app-nodejs-todo/
```

2.Install the required dependencies:


```bash
npm install
```
3.Open the project in your IDE, and then open the index.ts file. For example, if using Visual Studio Code:

```bash
code .
```
4.In line 14 of the index.ts file, replace 'YOUR\_APP\_ID' and 'YOUR\_TOKEN' with your app ID and playground token. (*Ditto Basics* \> [Getting Your Access Credentials](/v4-5/onboarding#s1Ovv))

```typescript
// replace YOUR\_APP\_ID and YOUR\_TOKEN with p 2ditto \= new Ditto({ type: 'onlinePlayground', appID: 'YOUR\_APP\_ID', token: 'YOUR\_TOKEN' })
```


5.Build the demo task app:

```bash

npm run build
```
6.Interact with the demo task app and simulate real-time peer-to-peer replication by running the demo task app in two or more separate terminals (one for each virtual peer):

```bash
node index.js
```
7.Using the commands that automatically appear in each of your terminals, add, remove, and modify documents as desired.

8.If you want to observe your changes sync with the cloud-optional deployment, the [Big Peer](https://docs.ditto.live/v4-5/basics#0bpDy), open the data browser in the [Ditto portal](https://portal.ditto.live/ "Ditto portal").
