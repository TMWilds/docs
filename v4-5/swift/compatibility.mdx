# Objective-C
<Info>
Ditto does not offer native support for apps developed in Objective-C.

If you want to use the Ditto SDK for Swift with an Objective-C app, you must use a bridge to integrate.

For a code walkthrough on how to create a bridge that calls into Swift from Objective-C, see the getditto > [example-swift-bridge-to-objectivec](https://github.com/getditto/example-swift-bridge-to-objectivec "example-swift-bridge-to-objectivec") repository in GitHub.
