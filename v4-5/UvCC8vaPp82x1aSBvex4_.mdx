## DittoSwift Version 1.0.18-alpha1
Released: Wed Dec 8, 2021, 9:25 am



 an issue where document IDs that were specified inside the document's value as opposed to being specified explicitly (as a separate argument to insert) weren't being processed correctly, potentially leading to bugs with merge and overwrite behaviors.



macOS (including Apple Silicon) and iOS simulator (on an Apple Silicon device) support has been .

## DittoSwift Version 1.0.16
Released: Fri Nov 19, 2021, 2:39 pm



Fix an issue with live queries that involved a limit, no offset, at least one document being deleted, and some other conditions being met. Live queries that met these conditions could report incorrect sets of matching documents.



Fix an issue that could potentially lead to an infinite loop in the replication system, meaning no sync progress would be made.

## DittoSwift Version 1.0.15
Released: Fri Nov 5, 2021, 3:03 pm



Ensure that when performing a sort that if a document that matches the filter specified via the accompanying find call doesn't have the key specified in the sort expression then it won't lead to an error. Now, if you're sorting in a descending order then the documents without the key specified in the sort will appear at the end of the set of results, after all of the documents that do have the key present. If you're sorting in an ascending order then the documents without the sort key will appear first in the set of documents, before all of the documents that do contain the sort key.



 handling of large integers in documents. Integers larger than Int.max were still trying to be handled as Ints, leading to crashes. We now correctly handle them as UInts when appropriate.



Add the ability to directly set values inside the closure passed to an update call with assignments done via = sets, e.g. collection.findByID("123").update `{ $0!\["color"\] = "white" }`



Fix a bug where some transports related calls were not being run on the correct thread and so could lead to a crash.

Released: Fri Sep 10, 2021, 9:21 am



Fix to stop a change in site ID from leading to an unnecessary error.

## DittoSwift Version 1.0.9
Released: Fri Sep 3, 2021, 3:38 pm



 support for getting information about all of the collections that the device is aware of. This is achieved by accessing collections() through the store object and then using the same sort of API used when getting documents in collections, i.e. exec/observe/etc.



 multicast as a transport option to the LAN config part of TransportConfig.



 new identity types: Online and OnlinePlayground. An Online identity should be used when running Ditto in secure production mode, logging on to Ditto Cloud, or using an on-premises authentication server. User permissions are centrally managed. Sync will not work until a successful login has occurred. An OnlinePlayground identity should be used when you want to test a Ditto Cloud app without authentication ("Playground mode"). This mode offers no security and must only be used for development.



The Production identity has been renamed to Manual.



 a DittoAuthenticator type, accessible via the Ditto object, which allows you to perform login operations when you're using an Online identity.



Similarly,  an DittoAuthenticationDelegate type that needs to be used when using an Online identity.



Report an error if more than one Ditto instance is started using the same working directory.

## DittoSwift Version 1.0.5
Released: Fri Jun 25, 2021, 3:36 pm



 a new find function that accepts a query containing placeholders in the form of $args.my\_arg along with a map of query arguments in the form of `{ "my\_arg": "some value" }`. The placeholders in the query will be replaced by a query-appropriate representation of the relevant value from the map of query arguments. For example, a query of color == $args.color with a query arguments map of `{ "color": "red" }` would internally be treated as a query of: color == "red".



 the ability to get a hash and/or a mnemonic (string) representation of the matching documents from a live query event. This means you can do something like this: let liveQuery = collection.findAll().observe() `{ docs, event in event.hash(docs) // e.g. \`1950015808188223905\` event.hashMnemonic(docs); // e.g. \`locate-quality-tina--helena-remote-cat\` // ... }`



Fix for using floats in queries.



Accessing the store property of a Ditto instance will no longer throw an error if you have not yet activated your Ditto instance with a valid license token.



Deprecated setAccessLicense and  a new function, setLicenseToken, which will throw an appropriate error if your provided license token is expired or invalid somehow.



Deprecated startSync and  a new function, tryStartSync, which will throw an error if your Ditto instance hasn't yet been activated via a successful call to setLicenseToken.

Fix issue with AWDL transport where it could end up in a stuck state.

## DittoSwift Version 1.0.0
Released: Wed Apr 21, 2021, 5:29 pm



This release is not compatible with any previous SDK releases. There are a number of breaking changes both in terms of the SDK API and in terms of the internal systems used by the SDK to perform operations such as synchronization. If you have previously made use of the Ditto SDK and wish to update to this version then note that you will need to delete all existing Ditto data otherwise you will run into errors. If you have existing data that you need to keep then please contact us and we can advise you as to how you can migrate your data.



The most notable API breaking changes are: Document IDs are no longer restricted to just strings. You can now create a document ID that is a string, integer, boolean, array, map, or null. This means that when making findByID or insert calls you now need to provide a DittoDocumentID object rather than a string. Similarly, when you access a document's ID it will now return a DittoDocumentID object instead of a string. The start() and stop() functions on the Ditto object have been renamed to startSync() and stopSync() respectively. They now also don't accept any arguments. If you wish to specify which transports you would like the Ditto SDK to make use of (along with any configuration that they might require) you now need to use the setTransportConfig function on the Ditto object, and pass to that a transport config object. The default transports that will be enabled are still the same as they were in previous releases of the SDK though, so if you have no custom requirements then you can simply change your start() call to startSync().



Lots of performance improvements and bug fixes.
