Kotlin Android Version 3.0.0[](#jua0a)
======================================

Released: Fri Dec 16th 2022, 5:38 am



Removed: the DittoRGA constructor. You cannot create new RGAs.



Removed: the deprecated DittoMutableRGA type. You cannot mutate existing RGAs.



Renamed: siteID property -> siteId in Ditto class



Renamed: DittoDocumentID -> DittoDocumentId



Renamed: DittoDocumentIDPath -> DittoDocumentIdPath



Renamed: appID property -> appId in DittoIdentity nested classes



Renamed: siteID property -> siteId in DittoIdentity nested classes



Renamed: DittoPendingIDSpecificOperation -> DittoPendingIdSpecificOperation



Renamed: docID property docId in DittoPendingIdSpecificOperation class



Renamed: DittoWriteTransactionPendingIDSpecificOperation -> DittoWriteTransactionPendingIdSpecificOperation



Renamed: docID property -> docId in DittoWriteTransactionPendingIdSpecificOperation class



Renamed: NoIDPresentInDocument -> NoIdPresentInDocument in DittoError.StoreErrorReason class



Renamed: InvalidLiveQueryID -> InvalidLiveQueryId in DittoError.StoreErrorReason class



Renamed: findByID() method findById() in DittoCollection class



Renamed: docID property -> docId in DittoUpdateResult nested classes



Renamed: docID property -> docId in DittoMutableDocumentPath class



Added: close() method to DittoLiveQuery, adding Closeable conformance.



Added: close() method to DittoAttachmentFetcher, adding Closeable conformance.



Deprecated: DittoLiveQuery.stop(), please use the newly  DittoLiveQuery.close() instead.



Deprecated: DittoAttachmentFetcher.stop(), Please use the newly  DittoAttachmentFetcher.close() instead.



Fixed: The Closeable returned from observeStatus is now held weakly allowing it to be garbage-collected when the reference goes out of scope.



Removed: observe() and observeWithNextSignal() methods of DittoPendingCollectionsOperation, DittoPendingCursorOperation, and DittoPendingIdSpecificOperation. Please use the corresponding observeLocal() and observeLocalWithNextSignal() variants along with a separate call to subscribe() instead. See https://docs.ditto.live/android/common/concepts/syncing-data#subscribe



Deprecated: DittoRemotePeer, DittoRemotePeerV2, DittoPeerV2Parser, DittoPeersObserverV1, DittoPeersObserverV2, DittoPeersObserverV1Callback, and DittoPeersObserverV2Callback types.



Changed: performance improvements.



Added: disableSyncWithV2 method to Ditto. This allows you to explicitly opt-in to disabling the ability to sync with Ditto peers running any version of the SDK in the v2 series of releases. Assuming this succeeds then this peer will only be able to sync with other peers using SDKs in the v3 series of releases. Note that this disabling of sync spreads to peers that sync with a peer that has disabled, or has (transitively) had disabled, syncing with v2 SDK peers.



Improved: reliability if app crashes occur while persisting authentication data.



Fixed: WiFi Aware stability when WiFi is turned on/off.



Improved: log increased detail to help debug blocked write transactions.
