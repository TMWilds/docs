description: "The `SELECT` operation, once executed, retrieves documents from a collection and uses clauses like `WHERE` to specify conditions for filtering the documents to return."

<Info>
DQL currently only supports the `SELECT *` operation for document retrieval. With `SELECT *`, all responses result in full documents.

Expect more advanced `SELECT` capabilities in upcoming DQL releases. For more information, see [DQL Roadmap Functionality](/dql/roadmap).

## SELECT \* Statements

The following syntax outlines the basic structure and optional clauses you can use within your `SELECT` statements to specify your conditions for retrieval:

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM your_collection_name
[WHERE condition]
[ORDER BY orderby_expression_1, orderby_expression_2, ... [ASC|DESC]]
[LIMIT limit_value]
[OFFSET number_of_documents_to_skip]
```


For instance, retrieve all documents in the `cars` collection `WHERE` the `color` property is set to the value 'blue' :

```sql DQL
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE color = 'blue'
```


To perform a `SELECT` and receive *all* document fields, including an embedded `MAP`:



## Clauses for Filtering

The following table provides an overview of the different clauses you can use to define specific conditions and calculations within your DQL `SELECT` statements to provide more granular control over your queries:

| **Clause** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| FROM | The required clause specifying the collection containing the documents for retrieval. (See [FROM](/dql/select#from)) |
| WHERE | Applies filtering conditions to restrict the documents included in the result set. (See [WHERE](/dql/select#where)) |
| ORDER BY | Specifies the sorting order of the result set based on one or more expressions. (See [ORDER BY](/dql/select#order-by)) |
| LIMIT | Restricts the number of documents included in the result set. (See [LIMIT](/dql/select#limit)) |
| OFFSET | Skips a specific number of documents before returning the result set. (See [OFFSET](/dql/select#offset)) |

### FROM

Required in each `SELECT` statement you write in DQL, the `FROM` element identifies the collection for document retrieval.

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM your_collection_name
```


For example, a `SELECT` statement querying documents from the `cars` collection:

```sql DQL
SELECT * FROM cars
```


### WHERE

The `WHERE` clause filters data based on either an expression or a set of conditions that narrow the result set returned to you:

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM your_collection_name
WHERE [condition]
```


For example, here is a basic `SELECT` statement querying documents from the `cars` collection based on a given address:

```sql DQL
SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE location.address = '123 Main St, San Francisco, CA 98105'
```


To demonstrate a more complex query, here is a `SELECT` statement that queries using multiple expressions and logical operators to further refine the criteria for document retrieval:

```sql DQL

SELECT * FROM cars
WHERE color = 'blue' AND features.trim = 'Standard' OR features.mileage > 10000
```


### ORDER BY

With the `ORDER BY` clause, if you'd like, you can integrate calculations or expressions in your `SELECT` statement. Then sort the resulting documents to return in either ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) alphabetical order:

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM your_collection_name
ORDER BY expression_1, expression_2, ... [ASC|DESC]
```


For example, here is a simple `SELECT` statement that uses the `ORDER BY` clause to query and sort documents from the `cars` collection in descending (`DESC`) alphabetical order based on the field value set for the `color` property:

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM cars ORDER BY color DESC
```


In this syntax:

- `your_collection_name` is the name of the collection from which you want to retrieve the data.
- `expression_1, expression_2, ...` are the expressions evaluated to sort the result. Expressions are resolved in order.
- `[ASC|DESC]` is an optional parameter that specifies the sort order. If omitted, the default sort order is ascending (`ASC`). To sort in descending order, you can specify `DESC`.

**Example**

In this example, the result set from the query will be sorted in descending order based on the values in the field:


```sql DQL
-- Sort by a given field_name
SELECT *
FROM your_collection_name
ORDER BY field_name DESC
```


For instance, here `"blue"` cars return first and other cars sort by the natural order in the collection:

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM cars
ORDER BY color = 'blue'
```


#### **Sort Order by Object Type**

In DQL, the hierarchy for comparing and sorting objects varies based on the following criteria:

- If ascending (`ASC`) order operations:
  - `boolean`
  - `number`
  - `binary`
  - `string`
  - `array`
  - `object`
  - `null`
  - `missing`
- If descending (`DESC`) order operations, sorting order is reversed:
  - `missing`
  - `null`
  - `object`
  - `array`
  - `string`
  - `binary`
  - `number`
  - `boolean`
- If evaluating values, `true` results are prioritized and ordered first followed by `false` results.

#### Expressing Sort Order

Unless explicitly defined as `DESC` in your query, Ditto defaults to sorting in ascending (`ASC`). So, if you want to sort in ascending order, you do *not* have to express that in your query.

### LIMIT

The `LIMIT` clause is used to restrict the number of documents returned by a query, allowing you to specify a maximum limit on the number of documents to be included in the result set:


```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM your_collection_name
LIMIT limit_value
```


In this syntax:

- `your_collection_name` is the name of the collection from which you want to retrieve the data.
- `limit_value` is the maximum number of documents you want to include in the result set.

For example, only return the first 10 documents from the `your_collection_name` collection:

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM your_collection_name
LIMIT 10
```

### OFFSET

The `OFFSET` clause is used to specify the number of records to skip before starting to return documents from the query result:

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM your_collection_name
OFFSET number_of_items_to_skip
```


In this syntax:

- `your_collection_name` is the name of the collection from which you want to retrieve the data.
- `number_of_items_to_skip` is the number of items before returning the result set.

Using `OFFSET` with `LIMIT` is a common way to utilize `OFFSET`; for example:

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM your_collection_name
LIMIT 10
OFFSET 10
```
