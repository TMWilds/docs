title: Types and Definitions
description: "Ditto Query Language (DQL) offers a set of *data types* designed to accommodate any edge sync scenario."

A data type is different than a standard scalar type by declaring merge behaviors, operations, and the spectrum of scalar types accessible for individual fields:

## Data Types

In DQL, you'll use three data types:`REGISTER`, `MAP`, and `ATTACHMENT` type. By default, fields in a DQL statement are assigned the `REGISTER` type unless otherwise specified by way of *type definition*.

Following are the key characteristics:

| `REGISTER`** (Default)**                                                                                                                                                                       | `MAP`                        | `ATTACHMENT`                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Last-write-wins merge                                                                                                                                                                          | Add-wins merge               | Last-write-wins merge        |
| Supports multiple scalar types, including primitive types, such as `string` and `boolean`, as well as a JSON blob, encapsulating multiple field‑value pairs that function as a single object.  | Supports embedded data types | Ditto attachment object&#xA; |

## Declaring Type Definition

DQL type definitions describe the schema of the documents within a specific collection — defining the field types within the collection and specifying the assigned data types for each field.

Since `REGISTER` is the default type in DQL, you only need to specify the type definition when overriding with type `MAP` or `ATTACHMENT` within your query.

To explicitly declare the type definition as `non-REGISTER` type, add a prefix of `COLLECTION` and the suffix of `(field1 data_type, field2 data_type, ...)` to list the fields within the collection and their associated data types:

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM COLLECTION your_collection_name (field1 MAP, field2 ATTACHMENT)
WHERE field1.rating > 100
```


In this syntax:

```sql DQL
... COLLECTION your_collection_name (field1 data_type, field2 data_type, ...) ...
```


- `COLLECTION` declares that the collection has a type definition
- `your_collection_name` is the name of the collection from which you want to set a definition.
- `(field1 data_type, field2 data_type, ...)` specifies the data type of each field such as `REGISTER` , `MAP`, or `ATTACHMENT`

### SELECT with Definition

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM COLLECTION your_collection_name (field1 MAP, field2 ATTACHMENT)
```


### UPDATE with Definition


```sql DQL
UPDATE COLLECTION your_collection_name (field1 MAP, field2 ATTACHMENT)
SET ...
```


### INSERT with Definition

```sql DQL
INSERT INTO COLLECTION your_collection_name (field1 MAP, field2 ATTACHMENT)
DOCUMENTS (...)
```


## MAP Type Specifics

The `MAP` (Add-Wins Map) contains fields with their own data type. Data types for these fields are defined using parentheses following the `MAP` keyword. For example, `MAP(sub1 data_type, sub2 data_type, ...)`:

```sql DQL
... COLLECTION your_collection_name (map_name MAP(sub1 ATTACHMENT, sub2 MAP))
```


### Single MAP

The syntax for a single `MAP` with all other fields type `REGISTER`:

```sql DQL
... COLLECTION your_collection_name (field1 MAP)
```


### Single ATTACHMENT

The syntax for a single `ATTACHMENT` with all other fields type `REGISTER`:

```sql DQL
... COLLECTION your_collection_name (field1 ATTACHMENT)
```


### MAP and ATTACHMENT

The syntax for a single `MAP` and a single `ATTACHMENT` with all other fields type `REGISTER`:

```sql DQL
... COLLECTION your_collection_name (field1 MAP, field2 ATTACHMENT)
```


### **Deeply Embedded MAP**

The syntax for a document hierarchy of depth two — a single `MAP` nested with another `MAP` — with all other fields type `REGISTER`:

```sql DQL
... COLLECTION your_collection_name (field1 MAP(sub1 MAP))
```

The syntax for a document hierarchy of depth four with all other fields type `REGISTER`:

```sql DQL
... COLLECTION your_collection_name (field1 MAP(sub1 MAP(s_sub1 MAP(s_s_sub1 MAP))))
```


## Data Type Operations

Data types have different operations available.

- Assignment operations are denoted with an equals (`=`).
- Functional operations are denoted with an arrow (`->`).

### **REGISTER Operations**

The `REGISTER` can only be set to a specific field. For example:

```sql DQL
-- Setting `field1` to 1
field1 = 1
```


### **MAP Operations**

The `MAP` type supports inserting and tombstoning of fields using the functional operators. Inserting a field is an implicit operation performed by assigning a value to a field or a child of the field.

To assign a default value to a field, use the `default()` operation.

To perform `MAP` operations, use the arrow `->` operator followed by parentheses `()`, which contain one or more operations on child fields of the `MAP`.

**Setting or Inserting **`field1.sub1`** to 1**** **


```sql DQL
field1 -> (
  sub1 = 1
)
```


**Tombstoning (Remove) 'field1.sub1'**

```sql DQL
field1 -> (
  sub1 -> tombstone()
)
```


**Setting the Value of 'sub1' to 1 and Tombstoning 'sub2'**


```sql DQL
field1 -> (
  sub1 = 1,
  sub2 -> tombstone()
)
```


**Setting the Value of **`field1.sub1.s_sub1`** to 1**

```sql DQL
field1 -> (
  sub1 -> (
    s_sub1 = 1
  )
)
```


**Setting the Value of **`field1.sub1`** as Default Value**

```sql DQL
field1 -> (
  sub1 -> default()
)
```


### **ATTACHMENT Operations**

To set the last-write-wins `ATTACHMENT` data type, provide an `ATTACHMENT` object:


```sql DQL
field1 = :attachment
```


### **Default Value Operation**

All data types can be set to a default value type using the `default()` functional operator.

- `REGISTER` → `NULL`
- `AWMAP` → Empty Map `{}`


<Info>
  `ATTACHMENT` → *NOT SUPPORTED*
</Info>


```sql DQL
field1 -> default()
```


### **Tombstone Operation**

To remove all fields from a document, use the `tombstone()` functional operator.


```sql DQL
field1 -> tombstone()
```

<Info>
  In Ditto, fields need to be marked as "deleted" for other peers to know the field has been removed.

Ditto does this by internally setting a `tombstone` metadata on the field and removing the value:

- When tombstoning a `MAP`, all children data types are iteratively tombstoned.
- Fields that are tombstoned are ignored during subsequent DQL statements.
- While tombstoned fields are relatively inexpensive, they cannot be permanently deleted. Therefore, tombstoning in large numbers may cause performance to degrade.

## Document Operations

Documents have the same data type operations as the `MAP`. For syntax, see [MAP Operations](/dql/types-and-definitions#map-operations).
