title: UPDATE
description: The `UPDATE` operation modifies the content of existing documents in a collection.
---

With an `UPDATE` statement, you can update specific fields within the documents based on specified conditions:

```sql DQL
UPDATE your_collection_name
SET field1 = value1, field2 -> [mutator], ...
WHERE [condition]
```

In this syntax:

- `your_collection_name` is the name of the collection in which you want to update data.
- `field1 = value1, field2 -> [mutator], ...` represents the fields to be updated and their corresponding new value or functional mutator.
- `[condition]` is the expression or set of conditions that determine which documents should be included in the result set.

## Basic UPDATE

Here is an example of a basic UPDATE operation:

```sql DQL
UPDATE your_collection_name
SET field1 = 'blue'
WHERE _id = '123'
```


## **UPDATE Multiple Fields**

The following snippet shows an exampleUPDATE setting multiple fields:


```sql DQL
UPDATE your_collection_name
SET
  field1 = 'blue',
  field2 = 0
WHERE _id = '123'
```

## UPDATE with MAP Type

When updating fields nested in a `MAP`, specify the field-value pairs you want to update.


For `MAP` syntax, see Ditto Query Language > Types and Definitions > [Map Operations](/dql/types-and-definitions#map-operations).


```sql DQL
UPDATE COLLECTION your_collection_name (field2 MAP)
SET
  field2 -> (
     sub1 = 2,
     sub2 = 'spring'
  )
WHERE field1 = 'red'
```


## Flagging Fields as Removed

In , you can mark a field as a *tombstone*. A tombstone is a flag signaling to remote peers that the field is deleted from the local Ditto store.

In Ditto, when performing an operation like an UPDATE, excluding fields from your payload does *not* remove the existing data from the system. In other words, Ditto ignores any fields you've omitted from your payload and therefore they remain unchanged by that particular operation.


To set a field as a tombstone, use the syntax `[field] -> tombstone()` as follows:


```sql DQL
UPDATE your_collection_name
SET your_field_name -> tombstone()
WHERE _id = '123'
```


### Setting a MAP as a Tombstone

Using the `tombstone()` functional operation, you can mark a `MAP` data type as deleted.

When a `MAP` is tombstoned, a metadata property is internally set on the field and all the data within the `MAP` is removed. This is done by iterating through all the fields in the `MAP` and calling `tombstone` on those fields.

For `REGISTER` and `ATTACHMENT` data types within the `MAP`,  flagging values with `tombstone` results in their deletion.


```sql DQL
UPDATE COLLECTION cars (properties MAP)
SET
  properties -> tombstone()
WHERE
  _id = '123'
```
