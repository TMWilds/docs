title: DQL Roadmap Functionality
description: This document outlines functionality in the DQL language that is in active development. This is not an exhaustive list of the features and functionality the Ditto team is tracking concerning DQL and aims to address larger functionality gaps.

<Warning>
  The functionality in this article is in active development and **NOT **supported in this version of the DQL language.
</Warning>

All syntax included in this article is sudo syntax added to express functionality. The final syntax may differ from the syntax included here.


## <Icon icon="road-barrier" iconType="solid"  size="28"/> Projections

A projection refers to an operation of selecting specific fields from a collection in a query result by allowing you to specify which fields you want to include in the output of a query while excluding others.


```sql DQL
SELECT field1, field2
FROM your_collection_name
```


## <Icon icon="road-barrier" iconType="solid"  size="28"/> Aggregates

Applied most commonly to grouped data or the entire result set of a query, use aggregation functions to perform calculations on a set of values and produce a single result, as well as summarize data across multiple documents in a collection.

Aggregate operations: `COUNT` `SUM` `MAX` `MIN` `AVG`

```sql DQL
SELECT COUNT(field1), SUM(field2), MAX(field3), MIN(field4), AVG(field5)
FROM your_collection_name
```


### <Icon icon="road-barrier" iconType="solid"  size="28"/> GROUP BY

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group documents based on one or more fields in a query. It allows you to group data together based on common values in specific fields and perform aggregate calculations on those groups.

```sql DQL
SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM your_collection_name
GROUP BY category;
```


### <Icon icon="road-barrier" iconType="solid"  size="28"/> HAVING

The `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause to filter the result of a query based on conditions involving aggregate functions. The `HAVING` clause allows you to apply filtering conditions to the grouped data in a query.


```sql DQL
SELECT field1, aggregate_function(field2)
FROM your_collection_name
GROUP BY field1
HAVING condition;
```

## <Icon icon="road-barrier" iconType="solid"  size="28"/> Aliasing

Aliasing allows users to assign a temporary name or alias to a collection or field in a query. Aliases are assigned using the AS keyword followed by the alias.

***Aliasing a collection***

```sql DQL
SELECT c.field1
FROM your_collection_name AS c
```


***Aliasing a field***

```sql DQL
SELECT field1 AS f
FROM your_collection_name
```

## <Icon icon="road-barrier" iconType="solid"  size="28"/> Multiple FROM Terms

Multiple `FROM` terms can be used to refer to multiple collections within a query. When you include multiple `FROM` terms, the result is a cross-product of the collections. This results in a larger result set that includes all possible combinations.

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM collection1, collection2
```

## <Icon icon="road-barrier" iconType="solid"  size="28"/> JOINs

Joins are used to combine documents from two or more tables based on a related fields between them.

Join types include: `LEFT JOIN` `INNER JOIN` `CROSS JOIN` `RIGHT JOIN` `OUTER JOIN`

```sql DQL
SELECT cars._id, dealerships._id, dealerships.location
FROM cars
INNER JOIN dealerships ON cars.dealership_id = dealerships._id
```


## <Icon icon="road-barrier" iconType="solid"  size="28"/> INSERT with CBOR

The `INSERT INTO` statement will support CBOR serialized data.

CBOR data is declared using `CBOR` keyword prior to the CBOR object.

```javascript JS
import { encode, decode } from "cbor";

const data = {
  _id: "123",
  field1: 0,
  field2: "blue"
};
const cborData = encode(data);

ditto.store.execute(`
	INSERT INTO your_collection_name
	DOCUMENTS (CBOR :cborData)`,
	{ cborData });
```


## <Icon icon="road-barrier" iconType="solid"  size="28"/> Secondary Indexing

An index is a data structure that enhances the efficiency of queries by providing a faster lookup mechanism for retrieving data based on specific attributes or fields. An index allows DQL to locate and access data more quickly, reducing the need for scanning the entire collection or table.


```sql DQL
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON your_collection_name (field1, field2, ...);
```

```sql DQL
DROP INDEX index_name
```

```sql DQL
SELECT *
FROM your_collection_name
USE INDEX (index_name)
WHERE field1 > 10000
```

## <Icon icon="road-barrier" iconType="solid"  size="28"/> Pre-Defined Type Definitions

Setting a pre-defined type definition will allow users to set a type definition once for a given collection instead of needing to declare it within each query.

```sql DQL
DEFINE COLLECTION your_collection_name (
  field1 REGISTER,
  field2 MAP,
  filed3 ATTACHMENT,
  ...
)
```

## <Icon icon="road-barrier" iconType="solid"  size="28"/> Cross Collection Transactions

Cross collection atomic modifications allows for multiple modifications to occur across transactions.

```sql DQL
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Update an employee's name
UPDATE employees
SET name = 'New Name'
WHERE _id = '123';

-- Update a department's budget
UPDATE departments
SET budget = 50000
WHERE _id = 'department_456';

COMMIT;
```
