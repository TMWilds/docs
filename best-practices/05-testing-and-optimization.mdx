Thorough testing ensures your app performs reliably in real-world conditions, including scenarios with poor connectivity or complex network topologies. This section covers best practices for simulating real- world conditions, testing sync behavior, and ensuring optimal performance during development.

[MAP Evaluation Criteria](<../Best Practices/MAP Evaluation Criteria.md>)&#x20;

Deciding between deeply embedded structures or a flat model depends on factors like data complexity, performance, size, and scalability. This guide helps you evaluate which approach best fits your requirements, with specific criteria for each model type to optimize your data architecture.

[Testing Best Practices: Big Peers, Small Peers, and Identity Switching](<../Best Practices/Testing Best Practices_ Big Peers_ Small Peers_ and Identity Switching.md>)&#x20;

This guide helps you test Ditto integration by using dedicated Big Peers for development and staging environments, ensuring scalability and isolation. It also covers techniques for testing Small Peers in isolation and provides guidance on dynamic identity switching for debugging roles, permissions, and sync workflows.

[Setting Routing Hints](<../Best Practices/Setting Routing Hints.md>)&#x20;

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring and managing routing hints to optimize peer connections in the Big Peer cloud environment. By grouping peers with similar data access patterns, routing hints improve performance for large document collections.
