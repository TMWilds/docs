  <Card title="Sync Handling" icon="rotate" iconType="solid" href="/best-practices/sync-handling">
This article provides best practices for handling sync in Ditto's mesh networks, focusing on efficient transport usage, query-based sync, conflict resolution, and offline-first models to ensure data consistency in distributed environments.

  <Card title="Conflict Handling" icon="code-merge" iconType="solid" href="/best-practices/conflict-handling">
In mesh networking, conflict handling ensures data consistency by using version vectors to track updates, deterministic merging for eventual consistency, and predictable resolution of conflicting data inputs.

  <Card title="Data Flow Management" icon="network-wired" iconType="solid" href="/best-practices/data-flow-management">
In mesh networks, efficient data flow is achieved through multiple transports (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), localized syncing to reduce latency, and flood-fill propagation for consistency. Using a multiplexer optimizes bandwidth, and conflict-free sync ensures consistency across peers.
