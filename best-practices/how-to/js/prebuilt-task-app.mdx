---

## Prerequisites

Before you can install Ditto, you must have the following:

- Ditto access credentials
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> active long-term support (LTS) version 18.x or 20.x
- Linux, macOS version 11 (or later), or Windows version 10 (or later)
- <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git</a>
- Integrated developer environment (IDE)


<Info>
* To get your access credentials, complete the [Get Started]().
* You can use any IDE you prefer; however, for optimal compatibility with the platform, Ditto recommends using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>.

## Installing the Demo Task App

To install Ditto in your environment, install and set up Ditto, and authenticate your client identity with the Big Peer:

<Steps>
    <Step>
Clone the <a href="https://github.com/getditto/template-app-nodejs-todo/" target="_blank">getditto > template-app-nodejs-todo</a> repository from GitHub:


```bash Bash
git clone https://github.com/getditto/template-app-nodejs-todo/
```
    </Step>
    <Step>
Install the required dependencies:

```bash Bash
npm install
```
    </Step>
    <Step>
Open the project in your IDE, and then open the `index.ts` file. For example, if using Visual Studio Code:

```bash Bash
code .
```
    </Step>
    <Step>
In line 14 of the `index.ts` file, replace `'YOUR_APP_ID'` and `'YOUR_TOKEN'` with your app ID and playground token. (*Ditto Basics *> [Getting Your Access Credentials](/best-practices/how-to/js))

```typescript
// replace YOUR_APP_ID and YOUR_TOKEN with p
ditto = new Ditto({ type: 'onlinePlayground', appID: 'YOUR_APP_ID', token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' })
```
    </Step>
    <Step>
Build the demo task app:

```bash Bash
npm run build
```
    </Step>
    <Step>
Interact with the demo task app and simulate real-time peer-to-peer replication by running the demo task app in two or more separate terminals (one for each virtual peer):


```bash Bash
node index.js
```
    </Step>
    <Step>
Using the commands that automatically appear in each of your terminals, add, remove, and modify documents as desired.

    </Step>
    <Step>
If you want to observe your changes sync with the cloud-optional deployment, the [Big Peer](/best-practices/how-to/js/), open the data browser in the <a href="https://portal.ditto.live/" target="_blank">Ditto portal</a>.
