In beta as an early preview, our Swift SDK now offers support for the visionOS target â€” enabling you to sync Apple Vision Pro devices on- or offline across devices including iPhone, Android, and other Apple Vision Pros.

For more information about the visionOS platform, see the official Apple documentation for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/visionos/" target="_blank">visionOS</a>.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Ditto SDK for visionOS on Swift:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Confirm you have the minimum requirements:

    - Xcode version 15.2 or later
    - visionOS platform version 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2

    </Step>
    <Step>
    Explore with either a prebuilt app, your existing Ditto-backed app, or a brand-new app:

    - To use a prebuilt app, clone, install dependencies, build, and run the DittoChat demo app upgraded to visionOS beta release version 4.8.0. ([Exploring with a Demo App](/best-practices/how-to/swift/visionos-beta-guide#VoKdd))

    - To enable Apple Vision Pro compatibility for an existing app already integrated with Ditto, add version 4.8.0 visionOS beta Ditto Swift Package dependencies to your project.

      For dependencies, go to the `getditto/DittoSwiftPackage` repo in GitHub:
      <a href="https://github.com/getditto/DittoSwiftPackage/releases/tag/4.8.0-visionos-beta.1" target="_blank">`DittoSwiftPackage/releases/tag/4.8.0-visionos-beta.1
      `</a>

    - To build a new app, install the Ditto SDK for Swift with the **4.8.0-visionos-beta.1** dependency rule. (See  [Swift Install Guide](/best-practices/how-to/swift/visionos-beta-guide#FonMHjPHDgLwDeZcHoonq))

    </Step>
    <Step>
    Once installed and your environment configured for visionOS, the Ditto Swift SDK automatically enables Apple Vision Pro compatibility for your app:

    </Step>
</Steps>


### Exploring with a Demo App

If you prefer learning by doing, run the upgraded DemoChat app with an Apple Vision Pro simulator:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    Ensure you have the visionOS version 1.0, 1.1, or 1.2 installed in Xcode.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Clone the <a href="https://github.com/getditto/demoapp-chat/tree/visionos-beta" target="_blank">`visionos-beta`</a> branch of the `getditto/demoapp-chat` GitHub repo:


    ```bash bash
    git clone -b visionos-beta https://github.com/getditto/demoapp-chat.git
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Navigate to the `/iOS` directory:

    ```bash bash
    cd demoapp-chat/iOS
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Set up the environment variables:

    ```bash bash
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Open the `.env` file located in the `/iOS` directory, and then enter your sync credentials for peer-to-peer authentication.

    Add your sync credentials (app ID and online playground token) available from the <a href="https://portal.ditto.live/?_gl=1*1cej9hc*_ga*MjAxODM3ODUyMi4xNzE4NjUzNzYz*_ga_D8PMW3CCL2*MTcxODc1NDE1OS45LjAuMTcxODc1NDE1OS42MC4wLjA." target="_blank">portal</a>. (See [Sync Credentials](/best-practices/how-to/swift/visionos-beta-guide#1zqHo9HLq-mO6v1AQnAzl))

    ```bash
    DITTO_APP_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    DITTO_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN=yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    From Xcode, using the Apple Vision Pro simulator, build the app and sync.
