<Warning>
**Syncing large documents can significantly impact network performance:**

Caution is advised when handling large binary data, such as a high-resolution image or video exceeding 50 megapixels; a deeply-embedded document; or a very large document.

Instead of storing files exceeding 250kb directly within a document object, carefully consider using `attachments` . For more information, see [Attachment Objects]().
</Warning>

## Creating Attachments

The following snippet demonstrates how to create a new attachment in the demo chat app:

<Steps>
    <Step>
    From the `createImageMessage()` function following the **Large Image** comment in the demo <a href="https://github.com/getditto/demoapp-chat/blob/main/iOS/DittoChat/Data/DittoService.swift#L340-L350" target="_blank">DittoChat</a> app for iOS code:

    1. Pass the `user` instance and the URL path where the avatar image is stored.

    2. Create a new `DittoAttachment` object by calling the `.newAttachment()` method.

    <Info>
    Since the demo DittoChat app does not require end users to upload an avatar image, declare the new attachment as an optional object.

    </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Call the `set()` function and, using the `DittoMutableDocumentPath` instance,  pass the `DittoAttachment` object

    <Info>

    The DittoMutableDocumentPath instance links the `user` document object ID to the `attachment` object and stores the `attachment's` data bytes and metadata properties to the given local Ditto store (Small Peer).
    </Info>

    </Step>
    <Step>
    Using the `DittoAttachmentToken`, initialize the `attachment` object.


    <Info>
        Later in the code, you'll invoke the `DittoAttachmentToken` to retrieve the `attachment` data from its current storage location, which could be either the Ditto store or the peer-to-peer mesh network. For more information, see [Replicating the Attachment](), as follows.
    </Info>


        ```swift
        func addAvatar(to user: User, imagePath: String) {
            // optionally, add metadata as [String: String]
            let metadata = [
                "filename": "\(userID)_avatar.png",
                "createdOn": ISO8601DateFormatter().string(from: Date())
            ]

            let attachment = collection.newAttachment(
                path: imagePath,
                metadata: metadata
            )!

            // add the attachment to the Alice user document
            ditto.store["users"].findByID(user.id).update { mutableDoc in
                mutableDoc?["avatarToken"].set(attachment)
            }
        }
        ```

        </Step>
        <Step>
        ```swift
    func addAvatar(to user: User, imagePath: String) {
        // optionally, add metadata as [String: String]
        let metadata = [
            "filename": "\(userID)_avatar.png",
            "createdOn": ISO8601DateFormatter().string(from: Date())
        ]

        let attachment = collection.newAttachment(
            path: imagePath,
            metadata: metadata
        )!

        // add the attachment to the Alice user document
        ditto.store["users"].findByID(user.id).update { mutableDoc in
            mutableDoc?["avatarToken"].set(attachment)
        }
    }
    ```

    Note that on the User model, the avatarToken variable is of type DittoAttachmentToken, yet we call the set() function with a DittoAttachment object. This can be confusing. The set() function, called with the attachment on a DittoMutableDocumentPath instance, causes the data bytes of the attachment at the given file location to be stored in the Ditto database, along with the metadata; the document property is initialized with a DittoAttachmentToken with which we will later fetch the attachment data asynchronously from the peer-to-peer mesh, or from local storage if it has already been fetched.

    </Step>
</Steps>



## Replicating Attachments

Peers can now find the document, fetch the attachment, and use the attachment image. If you want to update a progress view, use the progress event value.

In the following example, we've wrapped DittoCollection.fetchAttachment(token\:deliverOn\:onFetchEvent:) in an ImageAttachmentFetcher struct for convenience.

```swift Swift
struct ImageAttachmentFetcher {
    var fetcher: DittoAttachmentFetcher?

    init(
        ditto: Ditto,
        collection: String,
        token: DittoAttachmentToken,
        onProgress: @escaping (Double) -> Void,
        onComplete: @escaping (Result<UIImage, Error>) -> Void
    ) {
        self.fetcher = ditto.store[collection].fetchAttachment(token: token) { event in
            switch event {
            case .progress(let downloadedBytes, let totalBytes):
                let percent = Double(downloadedBytes) / Double(totalBytes)
                onProgress(percent)
            case .completed(let attachment):
                do {
                    let data = try attachment.getData()
                    if let uiImage = UIImage(data: data) {
                        onComplete(.success(uiImage))
                    }
                } catch {
                    onComplete(.failure(error))
                }
            default:
                print("Error: event case \(event) not handled")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Notice that we update a progress view by calling the `ImageAttachmentFetcher` struct with a progress handling closure and a completion handler for handling the fetched image. Since the attachment fetcher must remain a globally available instance for the entire duration of the asynchronous fetch operation, we maintain a strong reference to the attachment fetcher as indicated with a property.

If, at any time, the attachment fetcher goes out of scope, asynchronous fetch operations silently abort and the Attachment API fails.

```swift Swift
// properties
var attachmentImage: UIImage?
var imageFetcher: ImageAttachmentFetcher?

let doc = collection.findByID(user.id).exec()!
let imageToken = doc["avatarToken"].attachmentToken!

imageFetcher = ImageAttachmentFetcher(ditto: ditto, collection: "users", token: imageToken,
    onProgress: { percentComplete in
        print("Percent complete: \(percentComplete)")
    },
    onComplete: { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let uiImage):
            attachmentImage = uiImage
        case .failure(let error):
            //handle error
            print(error.localizedDescription)
        }
    }
)
```
