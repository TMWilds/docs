title: Batch Write Transactions
description: Use a write transaction when you want to combine multiple database operations into a single atomic transaction.

## Cross-Collection Operations

The legacy query API methods support atomic operations across collections. For more information, see `ditto.store.write` in your language's API reference.

<Warning>
Cross-collection atomic write transactions are currently unsupported by Ditto Query Language (DQL); development is actively in progress.
</Warning>

## Implementing Global Async Transactions



For example, in Swift, use `DispatchQueue.global`, as follows:

```swift Swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .default).async {

    ditto.store.write { transaction in

        let scope = transaction.scoped(toCollectionNamed: "passengers-\(thisFlight)")

       // Loop inside the transaction to avoid writing to database too frequently
        self.passengers.forEach {
            scope.upsert($0.dict)
        }
    }
}
```
