Securing data in a peer-to-peer environment requires careful consideration of how information is accessed, shared, and protected. This section addresses best practices for implementing role-based access control, ensuring secure peer-to-peer communication, and maintaining privacy when handling sensitive data.



[Maintaining Privacy in Peer-to-Peer Communication](<../Best Practices/Maintaining Privacy in Peer-to-Peer Communication.md>)&#x20;

This article highlights key privacy practices in peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, including end-to-end encryption, anonymized peer discovery, data minimization, and user control over data sharing.

[Secure Peer-to-Peer Communication](<../Best Practices/Secure Peer-to-Peer Communication.md>)&#x20;

Best practices for securing peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, focusing on using end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication (via OAuth or JWT), secure transport protocols like WebSockets, and regular key rotation to safeguard data from interception or unauthorized access.

[Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](<../Best Practices/Implementing Role-Based Access Control _RBAC_.md>)&#x20;

Article outlining best practices for implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in peer-to-peer communication systems, focusing on the least-privilege principle, hierarchical role management, secure token-based authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth), dynamic role updates, and regular auditing and logging to maintain security and prevent stale permissions.
