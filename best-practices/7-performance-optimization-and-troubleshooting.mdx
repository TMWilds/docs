<Card title="Device Storage Management" icon="hard-drive" iconType="solid" href="/best-practices/pCZgBpKcap9tMliT8K4p_"> Optimize data storage by using a soft-delete pattern and the EVICT API to free up disk space. Implement Time-to-Live (TTL) strategies to manage document retention, balancing performance and resource usage while ensuring relevant data persists.</Card>

<Card title="Large Binary Files" icon="file-binary" iconType="solid" href="/best-practices/4Mugq3GOSbi46hjEECrQT">
 For syncing large binary data or files, use Ditto's attachments feature instead of embedding them as bytes in documents. Attachments are not synced by default and must be explicitly fetched using an attachment token linked to the document.
