## What are Ditto Tools?

When we are attempting to debug or monitor the connectivity/performance of Ditto sometimes logs aren’t enough. Sometimes we need observability to gain more insight and that is where Ditto Tools come in.

## What platforms are Ditto Tools available for?

Ditto Tools are currently available for Android, Swift and C# .NET. Each one has their own open source repo that contains the latest version as well as the steps to implement:

</CardGroup>
## What tools are available?

There are several tools available for both Android and Swift and a description of each one is available via the README of their respective repos. At the time of writing only the Presence Viewer is available for C# .NET.

## How quickly can I implement tools?

Tools are distributed via their platforms’ respective package managers: Maven Central for Android, SPM for Swift, and NuGet for .NET. Both the Android and Swift versions of tools have a single entry point that allows you to implement all the tools at once.

Once you have imported the required dependency, you should be able to place a UI element within your app and be able to build and run within about 15 minutes. All tools can also be included individually.

## I found a bug or would like to request a feature for a tool

If you have found a bug or would like to request a feature you can always [open a support ticket.](https://support.ditto.live/) Our team will look into it and will prioritize the work once we have estimated it.

Another alternative is to contribute! All the tools are open source, and we welcome contributions as PRs or GitHub issues.

## Who maintains Ditto Tools and manages the releases?

We have an internal Ditto Tools team that maintains the tools. We do not have a set release schedule, and instead we release tools as needed. As mentioned previously, all the tools are open source, and we’re happy to accept contributions and will work with you to publish a release as needed.
