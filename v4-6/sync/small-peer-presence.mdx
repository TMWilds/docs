title: Small Peer Presence
description: "Independent of the internet, Ditto syncs data among peers by establishing sessions and forming a mesh network using all available network transports on a device. In this process, discovered peers create a *presence graph* by advertising and forming connections."

    title="Presence Graph"
  >
Much like a conventional city map with roads, the presence graph is like a guide for peers, helping them determine the shortest and fastest paths to route updates from point A to B.

If an intermediate peer becomes unavailable, the presence graph facilitates route updates, ensuring continuous connectivity similar to navigation apps like Google Maps. This flexibility allows the multihop links, established during the *flood-fill process*, to adapt as devices join and leave the mesh network.

The flood fill process, or *flooding* for short, involves propagating data across connected peers regardless of their queries. For more information, see [Mesh Networking 101](<./../../Basic Concepts/Mesh Networking 101.md>).

Represented by different colors in the following graphic, available transports establish multiple active connections simultaneously within the mesh:

    title="Presence Viewer"
  >
Standard across all of Ditto's demo apps is the *presence viewer*.

The presence viewer, shown on the right, is a graphical user interface (GUI) built by Ditto that offers a realtime visualization of all connections within your mesh.

When you launch the viewer, you'll notice that the colors of the lines representing peer-to-peer connections are constantly changing to adapt to the most efficient transports available.

  <Accordion
    title="Security of Connections"
  >
Ditto ensures the security of each connection â€” unlike Bluetooth, which lacks native security measures, Ditto provides end-user devices with certificates signed by a root certificate, allowing identification of connecting devices.

In addition, all connections are encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.3.


<Info>
  Approval for NSA-level encryption through collaboration with the military is in progress and expected to be available later this year. For more information, contact Ditto. (See [Human Support](https://docs.ditto.live/v4-6/sync/small-peer-presence#R-R6Mnu5XSKL0xLrzHCwH))
