## Prerequisites

- Install latest version of <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank">Rust</a>

## Setup

Create a new project with `cargo init --bin` and add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file.

> \[dependencies.dittolive-ditto]
> version =
>
> \{{rust_install_code_version}}
>
>

```none Bash
cargo build
```
## Usage

See the [example code in GitHub](https://github.com/getditto/samples/tree/main/rs).

## Suggested App Filesystem Structure

Rust doesn't prescribe any particular structure for your project's layout on the end user's device filesystem. The following is one recommendation

- `AppRoot/AppExecutable` - The path of your app's executable. Everything else should be relative to this. The binary component of Ditto may optionally be statically linked into this executable (default).
- `AppRoot/libdittoffi.dll` -  The path to the binary ditto library if using the shared library version. Configure your app's linker to search for the library here (e.g. `@executable_path/../libdittoffi.dylib`). You will need to copy this shared library from `target/<profile>/build/dittolive-ditto-sys<hash>/out` when distributing your app.
- `AppRoot/ditto_data/` - Base directory for all locally stored Ditto data.

## Cross Compiling with the Ditto Rust SDK

The rust compiler is natively capable of cross-compiling for a wide range of targets. You will need to configure a local `.cargo/config.toml` file in the root of your project directory to provide the necessary `rustc`, linker, and potentially C compiler arguments. For most targets you will need to provide an alternative sysroot for your target (not host) platform, often exposing a POSIX C library, header files, binutils, and a linker.

## Common Issues

### **Diagnosis**

The Ditto SDK build.rs script failed to download an appropriate ditto binary for your target platform.  Look at the build script's log at `target/<profile>/build/dittolive-ditto-sys-<hash>/stderr` for any errors.

Check your internet connection is live and Ditto version number is correct. Inspect the downloaded library in the cargo build cache (default is `target/<profile>/build/dittolive-ditto-sys-<hash>/out/libdittoffi.{a,dylib,so,dll}`) using your platforms utilties such as `file`, `otool`, `readelf` or similar. Try updating to the latest release of `dittolive-ditto`. You can also manually download the binary yourself.

### **Solutions**

1. Try updating to a more recent version of `dittolive-ditto` .
2. Manually download the library yourself and verify it completes successfully.
3. Force the build script to look for the library in a specific directory by exporting `DITTOFFI_SEARCH_PATH` during compilation and execution.
