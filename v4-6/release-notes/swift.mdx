## 4.6 Version Release

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Added: Support for runtime configuration using DQL">
Ditto introduced an experimental feature for retrieving, configuring, and restoring default configurations for the Ditto peer-to-peer system at runtime using Ditto Query Language (DQL) syntax.


<Info>
  The Customer Experience team offers this feature to customers when appropriate for your scenario and use case.
</Info>


Through two new statements:`ALTER SYSTEM` and `SHOW`, you can change parameters, settings, and configurations while your peer-to-peer system is actively running.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fixed: Accumulation of unsubscribed documents">
  Due to recent improvements to the sync protocol, Small peers no longer accumulate unsubscribed documents when subscription statuses are changed.

  This fix ensures that the peer-to-peer system prevents retaining unnecessary data, resulting in optimized resource usage.


  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changed: Sync protocol to streamline the sync process
">
Ditto's recent adjustments to the sync protocol have decreased the exchange of redundant data during re-synchronization, improving the efficiency and stability of the sync process.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Changed: Sync protocol so peers use the latest version">
  Ditto decoupled sync protocol from conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) so peers now prioritize using the latest supported protocol version for data exchange.

  Even if your app uses legacy CRDTs, you'll benefit from this backward-compatible change.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Improved: API reference for `sort()` method">
  The documentation for the `sort()` API method on cursor operations has been updated to provide clearer explanations of behavior in cases where the specified field for sorting is missing.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Improved: Parser error messages">
    Now, parser error messages focus more on indicating the location of errors within the input code, rather than suggesting potential fixes.&#x20;

    With this improvement to the API reference, you have better guidance in debugging your code.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fixed: An issue where Ditto Link could enter an infinite loop">
  This fix addresses a specific bug where Ditto Link could go into a "forever loop" under certain conditions. This loop, caused performance issues and could potentially lead your app crashing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fixed: Inconsistent handling of legacy query-builder APIs">
  Before this fix, there were issues with incorrect casting to `boolean` values, leading to inconsistent behavior. This update ensures that values are cast properly, resulting in consistency across your app.

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Added: Comparison operations for legacy query-builder APIs
">
  If you're using legacy CRDTs in your app, now you can perform comparisons with `ATTACHMENT` objects.&#x20;

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Fixed: Limitation in fetching attachment tokens">
Previously, DQL queries were limited in their ability to retrieve the pointer that Ditto uses to fetch your `ATTACHMENT` object.&#x20;

Now you can query the following additional fields to improve query capabilities:

| **Detail**    | **Description**                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Attachment ID | A cryptographic hash of the attachment's contents. (See Organizing by ID and Attachment Token)         |
| Metadata      | Additional information about the attachment, such as its name, type, and so on. (See Attachment Token) |
| Blob Length   | The size of the blob data in terms of length (`len`) in bytes. (See Blob Store)                        |

Following is an example document showing the fields added in this release:

```json
{
    "_id": "abc123",
    "make": "Hyundai",
    "year": 2018,
    "color": "black",
    "picture": {
        "id": "<unique identifier>",
        "metadata": {
            "mime_type": "image/jpeg",
            "name": "car_stock_photo.jpg",
        },
        "len": 123
    }
}
```

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title=" Fixed: Error handling when creating an `ATTACHMENT`">
We've improved error handling mechanisms to manage input-output (IO) errors that may result during the creation of `ATTACHMENT` objects.&#x20;

Now you'll receive clearer feedback when encountering errors so you can prevent potential crashes and improve the overall stability of your app.

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Fixed: Internal data-decoding functions">
Fixed: Improved internal data decoding functions to prevent API crashes under certain inputs:

We've improved the software component for handling tasks such as byte parsing, character decoding, and data type conversion. Instead of crashing, like before, the API returns an error.

  </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Fixed: Issues causing crashes when preparing to sync">
There were issues causing app crashes during the preparation phase for syncing data to remote peers.&#x20;

With these improvements, the likelihood of encountering errors during syncing has been significantly reduced.

  </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Added: Replacement for deprecated `getData()` method">
Now, when accessing attachments, use the new `data()` API method on `DittoAttachment`.
  </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Added: `JSONDecoder` functionality for `DittoQueryResultItem` class">
We've added the `jsonData()` method that, once invoked, returns a `Data` object that you can use to integrate the results into your JSON decoding workflows.&#x20;
  </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Added: `fetchAttachment()` and `fetchAttachmentPublisher()`">
      These new variants accept an attachment token dictionary representation provided by the value of `DittoQueryResultItem`.

  </Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Added: Replacement `DittoStore` class for working with attachments">
Previously, you'd create attachments using a method in the `DittoCollection` class, which has since been deprecated.

**New Method for Creating Attachments**

This release rolls out a replacement `DittoStore` class with a new API method for creating `ATTACHMENT` objects:

`newAttachment()`

This new way of creating attachments comes with improvements, such as asynchronous execution. Meaning, it does not block your main thread.&#x20;

**New Property for Managing Fetching**

With the `attachmentFetchers` property, keep track of ongoing attachment fetching operations.

**New Mechanism for Handling Fetching-Related Errors**

If there are any issues fetching attachments, the `fetchAttachment()` method now throws `DittoError`.

**New Document Field Properties for Identifying Attachments**

The following new properties that you can query to increase the efficiency of fetching operations:

| **Property** | **Description**                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`         | A cryptographic hash of the attachment's contents.                               |
| `metadata`   | Additional information about the attachment, such as its name, type, and so on.  |
| `len`        | The size of the blob data in terms of length (`len`) in bytes.                   |

**New Method for Retrieving Length of Attachments**

The `getLength()` method provides a way to determine how large an attachment is in terms of its bytes.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title=" Changed: Log level for `DittoCollection` class (deprecated)"
  >
Calls made to the `newAttachment()` method on the recently deprecated  `DittoCollection` class now log at the `error` log level.&#x20;

  </Accordion>
    <Accordion
    title="Fixed: Issue related to attachment token schema"
  >
We fixed an issue related to the structure representing attachment tokens provided by the `value` of  `DittoQueryResultItem` so that the schema accurately represents the content of attachment tokens.&#x20;

The token is now provided as a dictionary of the form `["id": "...", "len": 123, "metadata": ...]` where `metadata` is a `` dictionary[String: String]` ``.
  </Accordion>
    <Accordion
    title="Fixed: Issues related to the presence graph"
  >
There was an issue where `DittoPresence.GraphPublisher` and `Ditto.RemotePeersPublisher` (deprecated) sent data to a subscribing peer before they were ready to receive it.

  </Accordion>
      <Accordion
    title="(Experimental) Fixed: Issue with mutual-link connections"
  >
Two peers targeting each other simultaneously in Ditto Bus or Query Overlap Groups, known as *mutual-link connections*, no longer struggle to establish a multihop connection to participate in the flood-fill process.&#x20;
